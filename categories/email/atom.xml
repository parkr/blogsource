    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Email notifications from web apps have been annoying us for months now. Ever since Twitter, Facebook and other notification-heavy apps began automatically sending notifications to us (alas, without our consent), public opinion seems to have developed a hatred for email notifications. But, I implore you, understand the flipside:</p>

<p>Email notifications in web apps is a way of unifying one&#39;s virtual &quot;inbox&quot;. Dealing with too many is overwhelming.</p>

<p>Keep email notifications around.</p>

<p>(But, for pete&#39;s sake, <em>ask</em> your users whether they want email notifications before you activate them for their accounts.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished up reading <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2012/08/05/managing-email-realistically/">Matt Gemmell&#39;s post on email management</a>. If you haven&#39;t read it, you&#39;ll want to do make sure you head over to his site and give it a quick read before continuing.</p>

<p>Firstly, I should say that I am a manager, a developer, a web developer and a university student. I get a shit-ton of emails, so don&#39;t think I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have developed an email attack-plan that works well for me, and I think works well for most people I know. This plan entails a seek-and-destroy method of achieving and maintaining Inbox Zero.</p>

<ol>
<li>Have a smartphone. Not only are these things super hip, but they&#39;re handy as hell for killing off swarms of emails you get throughout the day.</li>
<li>Use your time wisely. Don&#39;t twiddle your thumbs while on the bus/train/subway on the way to work. Rather, delete the worthless emails and read through the important ones. Re-mark them as unread until you get to the office.</li>
<li>Leverage the full keyboard. After the longest commute you&#39;ve ever had to make, you&#39;ve deleted or archived the bogus emails, so now you just have an inbox of awesome emails to go. Spend a half hour to an hour to get back to Inbox Zero. As Matt suggests, read the ones from your friends first &mdash; they&#39;re always hilarious/useful/intriguing/important.</li>
<li>Go through your work emails after you&#39;ve had a good laugh. You&#39;ll be in a better mood when you tell the designer you&#39;re working with that they&#39;re crazy and you won&#39;t come off as such a jerk. Win. Be detailed with these, but be very precise and concise - no one likes a long email.</li>
<li>Next, family. They&#39;re usually cute and/or stupid. Send a quick reply (&quot;Cute! Love, Parker&quot;) and archive. Boom, done.</li>
<li>Resume your daily work. Do <em>not</em>, I repeat, <strong>DO NOT</strong> leave your mail client open. You should work without disturbances. Let them emails come in and sizzle a little in your inbox. If someone needs something absolutely immediately, they&#39;ll have your phone number and give you a call.</li>
<li>Half an hour before lunch, conduct seek-and-destroy operation burrito sandwich with egg and cheese, i.e. achieve Inbox Zero again. You may want to leave the work emails until later when you&#39;re not irritable (you&#39;re hungry, remember?).</li>
<li>Eat lunch and laugh at animals making fools of themselves or watch an inspiring <a href="http://ted.com">TED</a> talk. Resume to work once lunch is over.</li>
<li>Take 5 minutes and reply to those work emails you put off. Resume work.</li>
<li>Half an hour before your work day ends, achieve Inbox Zero again.</li>
<li>Turn off anything on your phone that will remind you that emails exist. No notifications, no automatic push emails, no badge icons. You&#39;ve left work and now you should spend time with you you care about.</li>
</ol>

<p>Moral of the story: more frequently going through your emails throughout the work day (but in set times that make sense) is the best route. Three is good enough for me on a normal work day, but it&#39;s more like 45 times during the school year. So many freaking emails.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, forget you have any technology whatsoever, cuddle up with schnookums (your retarded cat) and read a novel. What a great day you just had.</p>
