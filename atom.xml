    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As many other Heroku customers, I rejoiced when <a href="https://github.com/progrium/dokku">Dokku</a> was released. To have
complete freedom to host as many apps with whatever databases or other plugins
I wanted &#8211; all for the cost of a small VM &#8211; was wonderful news.</p>

<p>I decided, for cost&#8217;s sake, to boot up one of those famed $5 <a href="https://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>
Droplets. I didn&#8217;t see that DigitalOcean provides an &#8220;app&#8221; for Dokku, so I
created a vanilla box of Ubuntu 13.04 and pressed on. I got everything up and
running and went to go deploy my first app, only to see this when I ran
<code>git push</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>runtime: panic before malloc heap initialized
</span><span class='line'>fatal error: runtime: cannot allocate heap metadata
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Well, golly, that sure is unhelpful. Looks like 512MB doesn&#8217;t cut it. Luckily,
we can avoid paying the extra $5/mo for the 1GB version by running the following
as <code>root</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>dd <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/zero <span class="nv">of</span><span class="o">=</span>/extraswap <span class="nv">bs</span><span class="o">=</span>1M <span class="nv">count</span><span class="o">=</span>512
</span><span class='line'>mkswap /extraswap
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then adding the following to your <code>/etc/fstab</code> file so the swap persists between
reboots:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>/extraswap         none            swap    sw                0       0
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then run this to enable <code>/extraswap</code> for swapping:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>swapon -a
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Boom. Now re-run <code>git push</code> and you&#8217;re in business. Magic!</p>

<p>Credit goes to the brilliant <a href="https://github.com/dhassler">@dhassler</a> for <a href="https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues/1555#issuecomment-22874190">the idea and the code</a>. Just
thought I&#8217;d share and preserve for my own benefit in the future.</p>

    <id>http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/11/04/taking-over-someone-elses-open-source-project</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last December (2012), <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com">Tom Preston-Werner</a> granted me <a href="http://blog.parkermoore.de/images/mojombo-added-parkr-to-jekyll.png">push &amp; pull access to
mojombo/jekyll</a>. I had written a <a href="http://blog.parkermoore.de/2012/12/11/an-open-letter-to-tom-preston-werner/">letter to Tom about the future of Jekyll</a>
and after a bit of persistence on my part, he relented:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.parkermoore.de/images/mojombo-added-parkr-to-jekyll.png" alt="mojombo added parkr to mojombo/jekyll" /></p>

<p>After a somewhat lengthy (and <a href="http://blog.parkermoore.de/images/jekyll-shall-inherit-the-earth.png">amusing</a>) conversation via Skype, I knew what
Tom&#8217;s priorities were for the project and where I could help. I started off
trimming down the number of open issues. At the time, they numbered just over 300.
After a quick visit to Buffalo to tackle some issues with <a href="http://quaran.to">Nick Quaranto</a> at a
Buffalo <a href="http://openhack.github.io">OpenHack</a> meetup at <a href="http://coworkbuffalo.com">CoworkBuffalo</a>, we were down to fewer than 200
open issues. I continued to work through them (much to my parents&#8217; dismay) all
through Winter Break. I was making good progress in the triage process: I knew
what many of the problems were with v0.12.1 and was formulating ideas about how
we might go about fixing them.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.parkermoore.de/images/jekyll-shall-inherit-the-earth.png" alt="jekyll shall inherit the earth" /></p>

<p>In January, I flew out to San Francisco to visit my sister for a week. I setup a
meeting with Tom to talk more about Jekyll and a plan for moving forward to a
v1.0.0 release. After about an hour or so at GitHub&#8217;s office in SoMa, talking
through various PR&#8217;s, Tom said I could start merging pull requests.</p>

<p>Consultation with Tom was challenging (he runs a multi-million dollar company
after all), as it was increasingly difficult for him to find time for Jekyll.
Despite <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/578#issuecomment-11414645">announcing that he was going to commit some of his &#8220;20% time&#8221; to Jekyll</a>,
he eventually abandoned that as impractical. As time went on, I received fewer
replies to my emails and eventually stopped sending anything that didn&#8217;t
absolutely <em>require</em> Tom&#8217;s input.</p>

<p>In March, I knew I needed more help. Tom wasn&#8217;t able to give much time and I
was trying to tackle this project alone. I had noticed that <a href="http://mattr.info">Matt Rogers</a>
shared my vision for Jekyll, so I asked Tom to add him on as a contributor to
the repo. By v1.0.3, he had started merging pull requests like a BAW$ and was
the sanity to my ridiculously-obsessed, inexperienced mind. Since Matt joined, I
haven&#8217;t really heard much from Tom. I write the occasional email and get the
occasional reply but he&#8217;s essentially phased out of the normal development of
Jekyll. Matt &amp; I have essentially taken over the project altogether.</p>

<p>By May, we were ready to ship v1.0.0. With the help of all the amazing
contributors, Matt, and my many mentors along the way, I finally ran
<code>rake release</code> for 1.0. The project was ours.</p>

<p>Since realizing that this product has few constraints outside of those I&#8217;ve
constructed for it in my mind (no one is going to tell me, &#8220;No, you may not
implement that feature or add that enhancement&#8221; without a valid argument as to
my solution&#8217;s invalidity), I&#8217;ve been thinking about what it means to take over
someone else&#8217;s project. <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/commit/d189e05d236769c1e5594af9db4d6eacb86fc16e">Jekyll is 5 years old.</a> I wasn&#8217;t there in 2008 when
it was first born as <code>autoblog</code>. Jekyll has changed a lot, as has its vision and
purpose. It&#8217;s used by lots of people now, whether via <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> or
locally.</p>

<p>Taking over someone else&#8217;s project takes a deep understanding of what the
project is and what it should be. As much as I wish Jekyll could make me
kr√§uterquark, that&#8217;s outside the scope of the project. Developing that lens is
crucial when taking over someone else&#8217;s project.</p>

<p>Mentoring on the part of the original owner/previous maintainer(s) is
exceedingly significant in the development of this critical lens. I am so
grateful that I was able to meet up with Tom back in January and to have some
amount of input from him as I understood what the project should be.</p>

<p>It would be ill-advised to take over someone else&#8217;s project without a partner.
Once Matt joined the team, Tom was able to step back into a much lesser role.
If I had tried to do what I did without any guidance (or at least sanity
checks), Jekyll v1.0.0 would have been a complete shit-show.</p>

<p>Trust in the community must also be earned. If people highly doubted my ability
to handle Jekyll, Tom would have likely removed me and found a replacement. I
argued a lot and got into some pretty heated debates at the beginning. There
were a couple people who didn&#8217;t share the vision that I had inherited from Tom
and stopped contributing to the project altogether. I feel like we now have a
pretty great community around Jekyll and are able to help each other out and
share cool plugins and sites that we made for/with Jekyll.</p>

<p>Taking over someone else&#8217;s open-source project was new terrain for me in
December, and still is today. It can be successful with the right amount of
mentoring and gradual removal of trusted feedback by the previous maintainer(s).</p>

<p>With some old projects that are brought back to life by the passing of the
torch, the new maintainers are able to experience the added bonus of feeling
like Frankenstein, which, I will say, is a pretty cool feeling.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/10/22/fix-the-government-open-source-legislation/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-22T19:45:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/10/22/fix-the-government-open-source-legislation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The following post was first written for a class at Cornell University taught
by Phoebe Sengers called &#8220;Designing Technologies for Social Impact&#8221;.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>We have a rather significant problem in the U.S. Indeed, our government seems to
be malfunctioning in a rather obvious and irresponsible way. The question of
today is simply: can it be fixed? If so, how?</p>

<p>One must first examine the problem and its root cause. The problem of
malfunction is most basically the conflict of multiple competing interests
without proper ideological or procedural basis for dialogue. The root cause of
this is that the existing platforms for dialogue (meetings, letters, rallies,
news spots) are severely outdated. What worked pre-internet is not passing the
test of time.</p>

<p>In particular, the legislative process is slow, dilapidated, and closed. This
leads to laws with earmarks and loopholes, confusing language and unnecessary
provisions. What if the law were made out in the open, for everyone to see, the
way open-source software is made? Version control and online access to bills
in-the-works as well as laws would certainly improve transparency. The Library
of Congress runs a system called THOMAS which is updated about daily, but the
bills aren&#8217;t organized logically and the user interface is fair at best.</p>

<p>The open-source legislation system envisioned here is based on an open-source
software system called GitHub. GitHub is setup like so: users and organizations
own repositories of code, text or binary documents. Each repository contains the
entire history of a particular set of documents as well as the &#8220;master&#8221; version,
or the latest repository-owner(s)-approved version of the document(s). Each
repository uses a version control system called git to keep track of the
information about the documents it contains: current versions as well as
previous versions. What is unique about this system, and the incredible strength
it offers for open legislation, is the concept of a &#8220;diff&#8221;. A &#8220;diff&#8221; is simply
the difference between a document at one point in time (referred to as a
&#8220;revision&#8221;) and the same document at a different point in time. Each repository
can be &#8220;forked&#8221; (cloned to a user&#8217;s own profile for editing) by a user; this
offers the most significant freedom of open-source, which is that anyone has the
freedom to modify a copy of the source and suggest changes to the main project
based on those derivative works. In GitHub parlance, the suggestion for a change
is called a &#8220;pull request,&#8221; but this term need not be adopted by this new
system.</p>

<p>To illustrate the design of the ideal system:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use git derivative for prose editing, rather than (line-by-line) code editing</li>
<li>Be online, accessible by anyone</li>
<li>Offer input from anyone in any form (suggested changes or just comments)</li>
<li>Do not make differentiation between users other than repository owner &amp;
non-owner (those with direct access to the repository and those who can fork
and suggest changes, but can&#8217;t incorporate those changes themselves)</li>
<li><p>Each repository is a proposed bill owned by the deciding body at the given
time during the legislative process as dictated by the U.S. Constitution.
Each repository contains a text file for each sub-segment of the proposed
bill as well as a rationale or goal, e.g.
  . (root)
  |
  |&#8211; README.txt (rationale, goal(s) of bill, and other meta info)
  |&#8211; section01.txt
  |&#8211; section02.txt
  |
  &#8230;</p></li>
<li><p>The entire process of the creation and formulation of the law is public and
open insofar as the culture can push for this</p></li>
<li>Moderator of some sort to ensure comments are productive (usually repo
owner). All of the comments that are hidden still exist inline and can be
shown by any reader of the comment thread</li>
<li>Membership of individual lawmakers in committees and other larger bodies
reflected in membership of organization accounts on the platform, which gives
them access to directly changing the legislation they have access to through
their organizational memberships</li>
<li>Offer &#8220;points of interest&#8221; as a means of discussion about a particular aspect
of a bill without the need to suggest changes. Can ask anything from &#8220;why is
this section worded this way?&#8221; to &#8220;what are the implications of this on
agricultural development in Upstate New York?&#8221; No question is too dumb and
all of them require an answer insofar as they are productive and relevant.</li>
<li>Easy citation of preexisting laws and other bills to allow for discussion
surrounding conflict or other interference</li>
<li>Access to signing letters written by President (usually interpretations of
pieces of the law for purposes of execution of the law)</li>
<li>Easy viewing of votes on final versions of bills (who, when, did it pass?,
etc)</li>
<li>Means of mentioning lawmakers in a comment if comment is directed at them,
or question is asked directly of them</li>
<li>Links to more information about execution by Executive &amp; other related
policy/law</li>
<li>Comments and changes can only be created from user accounts, e.g. David
Skorton can suggest a change, but Cornell University cannot.</li>
<li>Users can subscribe to updates from a bill repository and receive all
information about changes that are made and discussions that occur.</li>
</ol>


<p>One negative aspect of this approach is volume and the issues that come
therefrom (see: student&#8217;s answer on Piazza page linked to below). As the number
of collaborators grows, the ability for those with direct access to the bills to
handle suggestions for modification is greatly diminished. How are the interests
of the few vs. those of the many weighed (e.g. individual comment vs comment from
organization such as NAACP)? From the perspective of the way government works
already, aides of the legislators who have access to the repositories will also
have mirrored access to accept and discuss changes and questions from citizens.
As each law is its own repository, the load is distributed over the many
hundreds of bill repositories being considered. Additionally, Nissenbaum &amp;
Benkler discuss the idea of self-selection and volunteerism as an element of
open-source. This applies very much so to the scalability of open-source
legislation and responses to citizens. If a citizen is not interested in a
particular bill, that citizen will not involve himself or herself with the
creation of that bill. This self-selection will greatly reduce the number of
individuals with whom the maintainers of the bills will have to contend with in
discussion about a bill and suggestions for change.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this idea is predicated on the idea that citizens, when given the
right tools, can reach compromise and have productive discussions to &#8220;get the
job done&#8221; efficiently and accurately.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/09/16/its-just-semantics-app-dot-net-alpha/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-16T19:53:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/09/16/its-just-semantics-app-dot-net-alpha</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post was <a href="http://2450fall2013.ning.com/groups/red-2450/blog/it-s-just-semantics-app-net-alpha">originally written</a> as an assignment for <a href="http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=12&amp;coid=90680">INFO 2450: Communication
&amp; Technology</a> taught by Professors <a href="http://infosci.cornell.edu/faculty/jeffrey-hancock">Jeff Hancock</a> and <a href="http://communication.cals.cornell.edu/people/drew-margolin">Drew Margolin</a> in
Fall 2013. The course focuses heavily on design of technologies. The assignment
asked for an evaluation of an online application or product based on the
principles outlined in Donald Norman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0465067107">&#8220;The Design of Everyday Things&#8221;</a>. It&#8217;s
a very basic look at the technology, but I thought I&#8217;d share it anyhow.</p>

<hr />

<p>App.net is a social platform designed from the beginning to be nothing more than
a platform for developers to build great social apps upon. This blog post will
be about the very first application built upon App.net, called Alpha. App.net
will henceforth be referred to as &#8220;ADN.&#8221;</p>

<p>The main purpose of Alpha is to demonstrate the ADN API in a somewhat familiar
way. Alpha behaves much the way Twitter does: a user creates posts, users can
follow other users and interact with them in the familiar way. The divergence
from Twitter (and other &#8220;microblogging&#8221; social applications) is twofold: a user
pays for his or her account, and the posts may be longer.</p>

<p>By asking the user to pay for an ADN account (which is used by Alpha as the
poster&#8217;s identity), the normal business incentives shift from building an
application (or platform) which optimizes for advertisement revenue to an
application (or platform) which optimizes for the happiness of the user (if
users like to use the service, they will continue to pay the $5/month or
$32/year). Twitter, Facebook, and Google are well-known for accepting user
detriment (in terms of the virtual design of the products) for greater
advertisement revenue. This is not the case with ADN (and by extension, with
Alpha).</p>

<p>On Alpha, posts may be up to 256 characters long and users can choose to attach
media to their posts. The &#8220;@&#8221; symbol is used to mention another user (the other
user receives a notification when this happens) and the &#8220;#&#8221; is used to denote
topics. With the longer character limit, one could easily surmise that Alpha is
attempting to make having asynchronous, open conversations online a bit easier.
The openness of being able to write anyone (divergence from Facebook) coupled
with the 256 character limit (a physical constraint) (divergence from Facebook,
and extension of Twitter&#8217;s idea that a post should be &#8220;bite-sized&#8221;) produce a
fantastic application for having chats with anyone about anything in a way
conducive to conciseness and to expressiveness. One common frustration with
Twitter is that conversations on it are very challenging, as 140 characters is
far too few to really say anything substantive. ADN hopes to remedy this
problem, and in my experience, arguments (and general discussions, for that
matter) have been incredibly easy and productive.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.parkermoore.de/images/app-net/app-net-alpha-feed.png" alt="Screenshot of alpha.app.net" /></p>

<p>Above, you see the home screen of Alpha (namely, mine). This shows the user&#8217;s
stream. The search box and post box (based on their physical attributes) afford
writing. The change of the &#8220;POST&#8221; button from grey to a nice deep red-orange
highlights a change of the mapping from a button that may not be pressed to one
that may be pressed (I would consider the change itself feedback). As the user
types in a post, the number (shown here as &#8220;256&#8221;) decreases by one for each
character that is typed into the box above it, providing very valuable feedback
about the user&#8217;s actions. This number&#8217;s presence also provides visibility for
the physical constraint placed on the size of the posts allowed in the service.
The buttons on the right of each post afford clicking and change color
(feedback) when clicked. All of the aforementioned design elements, in addition
to the placement of the post box at the top, suggest that the application is
trying to get the user to submit content to his or her stream. The feed below
seems to indicate that the application wishes for perusal and interaction of
other users&#8217; posts by the logged-in user.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.parkermoore.de/images/app-net/app-net-alpha-post.png" alt="Screenshot of a singular post" /></p>

<p>As you saw above, each post is given its own box. There are 5 interactions which
only show up when the user mouses-over the post: &#8220;Discussion,&#8221; &#8220;Reply,&#8221; &#8220;via
(app),&#8221; &#8220;Mute User,&#8221; and &#8220;Report&#8221;. In order to better facilitate the app&#8217;s goal
of interaction, it would make sense for the &#8220;Discussion&#8221; and &#8220;Reply&#8221; buttons to
always be shown. This would improve the visibility of the interaction paradigms
and afford interaction without the user making the first move (to mouseover).</p>

<hr />

<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>

    <updated>2013-05-30T15:56:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/05/30/dealing-with-distraction</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dealing with distraction for those of us who live with AD(H)D is a constant struggle, and
can be especially difficult for those of us who must daily solve large, complex problems.
This post describes what it is like to be a programmer with ADD and some strategies I&#8217;ve
developed to help make myself more effective.</p>

<p>To solve complex problems by programmatic means, one needs to be able to focus. To find
the best solution to any problem, one needs to be able to focus. In short, an effective
worker is one who can focus.</p>

<p>For those of us who live with the difficulties of AD(H)D every day, this fact - this
dependence upon a kind of mental discipline - is glaringly obvious. Our constant struggle
to focus means we are not as efficient as our non-ADD peers when asked to complete a
single task. We get distracted by the sound of the wind, the tap of a colleague&#8217;s fingers
on his desk, or the sound of people talking walking past our window. The slightest noise
or change (by a separate entity) in the visual landscape will cause us to loose our train
of thought nearly immediately.</p>

<p>For those of you who can focus relatively easily in distracting environments, I offer this
metaphor to help you understand a bit more of how it is it live with such an affliction.
Imagine you are swimming in a lake with a basketball. The depth at which you swim is your
level of concentration - the deeper you swim, the more focused you are and thus the less
susceptible to distraction you are. Imagine further that a day&#8217;s worth of work is like
swimming the length of the lake, and your goal is to swim as deeply as possible for as
far as possible. The problem is that you have to do all this while holding onto the
fully-inflated basketball. The longer you swim underwater, the harder it is to keep the
ball (and yourself) deep underwater. During your swim from one end of the lake to the
other, you are pulled up to the surface very frequently, only able to keep the ball
underground for a short while at a time. This is what it&#8217;s like to live and work with ADD.</p>

<p>The inability to focus on a given problem for more than a few minutes at a time causes
severe problems for all employees with ADD, but especially for developers who have to
delve into a problem, process it, and produce a solution quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of various solutions will vary person to person, but these helped me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find a quiet, solitary place to work (avoid working in a place where people socialize)</li>
<li>Turn off all notifications when working (fetch updates at will instead)</li>
<li>Play calm, simple music without words, or work in a place where the background noise
doesn&#8217;t change</li>
<li>Keep the room cool in temperature</li>
<li>Work on one thing at a time and work until it is completed</li>
<li>Plan out finer details for a large project</li>
<li>Get enough sleep</li>
<li>Medicate with some sort of stimulant</li>
<li>Keep your workspace empty of clutter and visual distraction</li>
<li>Keep snacks by your desk (like almonds or dried fruits) to keep your energy up
throughout the day</li>
<li>Exercise to exhaustion at least every other day</li>
<li>Consciously avoid doing several things at once, like listening to a YouTube Lecture and
checking your Twitter feed on your phone at the same time</li>
<li>Avoid depressants like alcohol</li>
<li>Write or engage in a creative, exciting activity which asks for your full concentration</li>
</ul>


<p>Following all of these with ADD can even be a challenge, but limiting the frequency of
distracting stimuli goes a long way to achieving focus and increasing your productivity.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/05/09/get-rid-of-senate-prayer/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-09T18:17:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/05/09/get-rid-of-senate-prayer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today, I was watching a <a href="http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/SenateSession4967">C-SPAN video</a> of a U.S. Senate session on
February 1, 2012. This was the first time I had ever watched a Senate session
from the beginning and, to my surprise, they began with a prayer.</p>

<p>Hold up. A prayer? In a session of one of our government&#8217;s highest legislative
bodies?! I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t be too surprised, what with the (often crazy)
Religious Right getting after the government with Bible-backed policies and
all. It was nevertheless astonishing to see the institutionalization of religion
in our government.</p>

<p>I generally like our government, but this changes everything. Man, I was angry.
I felt betrayed and undermined - like I was worth nothing to anyone in D.C.</p>

<p>So I wrote to my senators:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Senator,</p>

<p>I wish to ask for the Senator&#8217;s thoughts on the opening prayer which begins a
Senate session. I have done my research and see that this prayer has been a
part of Senate procedure since 1789 and was recommended by Benjamin Franklin
about two years previous, but I question its place in our secular government.
It is, frankly, inappropriate that any governmental body in our United States
of America be so closely tied to one religious creed in a nation with many
hundreds and thousands of religious belief systems. I will not deny that
religion is a part of politics - a belief in a certain religious creed often
results in an election win - but it has absolutely no place in governance.
It is insulting to think that any one religion is given special treatment in
our governments.</p>

<p>I ask the Senator to introduce a bill which will put an end to this Senate
Prayer, for, while Mr. Franklin may have been right in 1789, he is most
certainly wrong now. We have moved past a blind reliance on God, and it is,
now more than ever, a hindrance on our Great Government.
God&#8217;s interference in our government has forced limited civil rights for
minorities, was a rationale for slavery, and is still fighting against a
Woman&#8217;s Right to Choose, a Citizen&#8217;s Right To Marry Whomever He or She Wishes,
Scientific Advancement in many fields and so on.</p>

<p>It is our imperative as citizens to think of each other first and to respect
the different viewpoints and beliefs of our fellow Americans. Honoring any
religion on our Senate floor is a betrayal of this principle, and it must be
stopped.</p>

<p>Thank you,<br />
Parker Moore<br />
Constituent</p></blockquote>

<p>If you care about religious freedom at all, I would urge you to do the same.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/05/06/jekyll-1-dot-0-released/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-06T00:59:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/05/06/jekyll-1-dot-0-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I&#8217;m proud to announce the release of Jekyll 1.0. There are a million
goodies and fixes to enjoy, and we&#8217;re (the still-active Jekyll core team
members: Tom, Matt and I) really excited to share this first major release
with you. Be sure to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/jekyllrb">@jekyllrb</a> for
updates on future releases and links to cool plugins.</p>

<p>Some quick highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>New subcommands: new, build, serve, and import</li>
<li>Amazing new docs at http://jekyllrb.com (thanks to @cobyism)</li>
<li><code>jekyll new</code> creates a new scaffold so you can get blogging even faster</li>
<li>Drafts, i.e. posts without dates</li>
<li>New &#8220;excerpt&#8221; feature on posts</li>
<li>Timezone configuration</li>
<li>&#8216;gist&#8217; liquid tag</li>
<li>Source directory protection</li>
</ul>


<p>&#8230; and <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/v1.0.0/History.txt">so much more</a>!</p>

<p>We also have an <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/">Upgrading</a> page that clarifies
some breaking changes and tips for upgrading to Jekyll 1.0.</p>

<p>As many of you know, Jekyll lay mostly stagnant for quite some time. At 0.11.2 and
0.12.0, it was pretty stable. It had some annoying bugs, but nothing much that
couldn&#8217;t be worked around or monkey-patched.</p>

<p>After using Jekyll last summer to help build
<a href="http://cals.cornell.edu">Cornell&#8217;s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences website</a>,
I took a renewed interest in seeing this project move forward. Last December,
Tom answered my offers to help with the development of Jekyll by adding me as
a contributor. I&#8217;m happy to say that it has come a long way since then, and
I&#8217;m very proud to be a part of a team that has pushed this project to new heights.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who submitted a pull request, and/or gave me advice along
the way. It has been great fun so far, and I look forward to working with you
all to push out future versions!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/04/30/an-afterlife/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-30T19:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/04/30/an-afterlife</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am not a religious man, yet I find myself curious about the prospect of an afterlife. Is
there something beyond this life, in this dimension, in this universe? While I don&#8217;t believe
in the traditional conception of an afterlife (one&#8217;s soul ascends to a blissful place, where
it inhabits all space and time for eternity), I do like to think we live on beyond the
time we take our last breath.</p>

<p>In ninth grade, I graduated to a Sunday School class which resembled a forum &mdash;
discussion-based learning. A retired history teacher, a Public Defender, and a social
worker led the discussions in this class. The dialogue probed our most deeply held beliefs
and asked profound questions about  life, spirituality, goodness, happiness, beauty, and
other similar topics.</p>

<p>One day, we were discussing the afterlife. The normal answers dominated the conversation:
&#8220;When one dies, one&#8217;s soul ascends into Heaven to be with one&#8217;s family members and with
God,&#8221; and &#8220;We exist everywhere and with everyone. We watch over those we love and help
them live good lives.&#8221; When the question came to me, I wasn&#8217;t sure how to respond. Can an
atheist believe in an afterlife? If so, did I?</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t given it much thought before, but I pondered it for a moment and concluded, &#8220;An
individual&#8217;s afterlife is the culmination of the memories others have of the individual.
It is the legacy that individual leaves behind and the impact that individual had on those
he or she encountered.&#8221;</p>

<p>The more I thought about it, the more it made sense. If we don&#8217;t have souls, how do we
explain this legacy of the afterlife concretely? The afterlife is not something experienced
by the deceased individual, but by everyone else he or she impacted.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='&#8220;They say you die twice, once when your
heart stops beating, and again when your name is said for the last time.&#8221;'>
I have not yet met anyone else who holds this belief I hold, but I invite you to explore
it and see of you can reconcile it with your beliefs about the afterlife. Banksy once
famously said (paraphrased by a friend): &#8220;They say you die twice, once when your
heart stops beating, and again when your name is said for the last time.&#8221; I can&#8217;t
believe there is something I will experience beyond my death, but I can believe that
others will experience their memories of me beyond my departure from this world.

    <updated>2013-04-22T02:12:12-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/04/22/we-mustnt-idle</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Our legacies on this Beautiful Earth are inextricably tied to the work we do, the
principles we stand for and the messages we spread. The apathetic nature of many of my
peers nowadays is heresy to the nth degree, and we can no longer stand idly by and watch
young people refusing to talk about the hard issues. If we‚Äôre to make any progress and
maintain this More Perfect Union, we had better get our act together and stand and fight
for the things we believe in.</p>

<p>It comes with a price, however. We must be informed. We must read the arguments of the
other side, debate them and reformulate our stance given the new evidence. In the same
way Newton used this inductive methods to formulate his three famous Natural Laws, we
must start with a problem we observe in our society, generalize a solution in the form
of legislation, judicial action or grassroots campaigning, and revise our message as new
information becomes available.</p>

<p>It is not enough to let Gov majors, English majors and law students run the country,
making sweeping decisions about how we may live our lives. It is not enough to defer to
those with means and wealth ‚Äì those with the ability to run a traditional campaign for
public office and influence those in public office ‚Äì in fact, it is the worst offense to
this Great Nation to allow the aristocracy of special interets to continue determining
the rule of law. We must stand up, as citizens, and fight for what sparks fire in our
bellies! We must stand up, as citizens, and say ‚Äúenough is enough‚Äù to special interests
and lobbyists who control Washington. Now is our time. If our country is to change for
the better, it will be because we ‚Äì the citizens ‚Äì made our voices heard and fought with
much gnashing of teeth for what we believe in and what we know is right.</p>

<p>This is the imperative of our generation. Let us act!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just read an <a href="http://www.upworthy.com/omg-google-tucker-carlson-and-gay-marriage?c=fea">appalling story by <em>Upworthy</em></a> that singles out 10 Democratic
senators who do not support full marriage equality for gays and lesbians. This
article is an absolute disgrace. <em>Upworthy</em> (and the <em>Huffington Post</em> for that
matter) should not be singling out Democrats who do not believe in same-sex
marriage as though it&#8217;s some unnatural digression from the widely-accepted
democratic platform. No, they should be listing <strong>every</strong> senator that does
not support same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>It is not a fundamental tenant of the democratic platform. It is a fundamental
tenant of reason, of American law, and of human equality. There is no good
reason every congressperson should not support same-sex marriage. This is not
about party lines. This is about human dignity and equality in the eyes of the
law.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/02/11/downtime-is-good/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-11T22:43:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/02/11/downtime-is-good</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just started working as an intern at 6Wunderkinder a couple weeks ago.
I am by no means an expert in devops (hell, I have only dabbled with a little
sysadmin in the past - nothing too serious) and I don&#8217;t really know what goes
into keeping a huge series of server up and running. I can say, however, that
I know the customer&#8217;s side of things. I know what it&#8217;s like to be a user of a
service which periodically goes through downtimes of noticable lengths. (I know
I&#8217;m not the only one here so you will probably relate to this observation as
well.</p>

<p>So today there was a blip of downtime for Wunderlist, a really awesome task-
management application by 6Wunderkinder. During this downtime, it occurred to
me: downtime can help the visibility of an application or service.</p>

<p>Hear me out: when the service is running smoothly, few will actually talk about
it. When it goes down, Twitter blows up with complaints and &#8220;ZOMG MY LIFE IS
OVER&#8221; tweets. These tweets, in a way, promote the service. The more frustrated
the tweet, the more apparent it is that the tweeter cares about this service.</p>

<p>As one who sees these frustrated tweets often about many services, I can only
conclude that a little downtime here and there is a great way for outsiders
to gauge how awesome a service is: if it goes down and people are upset, then
the service is probably worth trying out (once it goes back up again). If the
service goes down and no one cares, then it probably isn&#8217;t worth your time.</p>

<p>So next time you see angry tweets, write down the name of that service and
check it out once everything is back in order. In all likelihood, you will
like the service, too, and you&#8217;ll be angrily tweeting next time it goes down.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s all about perspective.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently signed up for simyo, a German cell provider. After installing the Nano SIM into my phone,
I noticed that the 3G connection to the mobile data network was failing. Got a weird error that said
I was not subscribed to a mobile data network. Which was obviously false.</p>

<p>So, I tweeted about it. Expecting a several-day delay in my support query from simyo, I totally resigned
to wait on mobile data until they got back to me. But luckily this new 6W family &amp; friends totally came
to my rescue. <a href="http://rafifyalda.id.au/">Rafif Yalda</a>, a former Wunderkind, totally came to my rescue in
<a href="https://twitter.com/rafifyalda/status/296664474885165056">a tweet</a>.</p>

<p>So if you ever run into a problem with your mobile network, ensure that your APN settings are correct.
In this case:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>APN: internet.eplus.de
</span><span class='line'>username: simyo
</span><span class='line'>password: simyo</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>THANK YOU RAFIF. This surely saved me many hours of frustration.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/01/03/my-favourite-apps-in-2012/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-03T01:36:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/01/03/my-favourite-apps-in-2012</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Below is a list of the apps I wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to live without this year.
To be fair to everyone, I&#8217;ve listed them in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>I know some apps are missing links to various versions, but if I didn&#8217;t use it,
then I felt it was best not to include a link to it on this list.</p>

<h3>101 Airborne (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/101-airborne/id531317549?mt=8">iPhone</a>)</h3>

<p>At this moment, this is one of only two games which I have installed on my iPhone.
I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game, and it is incredibly well-done,
to boot.</p>

<h3>Diet Coda (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/diet-coda/id500906297?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>When I had to have the logic board in my MacBook Pro replaced, I had to hand in
my computer for a week. I am practically addicted to development, and this app
by Panic, Inc. of Portland, Oregon, served me well during those tough times.</p>

<h3>Dropbox (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/install">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Dropbox gives me the freedom to aimlessly roam between devices without losing
any progress. I can work on my mac for a bit, then pick up my iPad and resume
my work right then and there. Dropbox far surpasses the ease-of-use of competitors
such as Box.com, and its native Mac application is far less intrusive, as well.</p>

<h3>Google+ (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google+/id447119634?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m a social media weirdo. I have to try out every one that comes along. I even
tried out <a href="http://app.net">app.net</a> for a while (I still have an account there).
I started using this app far more after the amazing redesign which happened
right around Christmastime. It was indeed an enjoyable occasion. I use G+ to stay
in contact with friends who now work at Google and with friends of mine who insist
on Google-only living: an Android phone, Google+ to communicate (Messenger), and
Google Docs to collaborate.</p>

<h3>Google Chrome (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chrome/id535886823?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Chrome on Mac is absolutely awesome. I use it obsessively.</p>

<p>Chrome on the iPhone is something I had to warm up to a bit more. It behaves far
differently than Safari on iOS and the controls are in completely different places.
After some adjustment, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate its incredible flexibility and
strength in the mobile realm.</p>

<h3>Google Maps (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>Apple Maps has yet to lead me to a hospital that isn&#8217;t there, or on a road that has
been demolished, but I still missed the Google Maps speed and accuracy. I have also
found that Google Maps is far better for finding nearby amenities, such as coffee,
gas, and food.</p>

<h3>Google Translate (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-translate/id414706506?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>While I am relatively proficient in the language, learning German is a process.
I have found this app very helpful during my studies and even when having a
causal conversation over Skype in German.</p>

<h3>Gmail (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-from-google/id422689480?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>As with G+ above, the redesign really did it for me. It was, all of a sudden,
a reliable, beautiful, and agile experience, to use this app. It was incredibly
buggy before (it seemed to be a product from Google&#8217;s insistence that online
mobile apps will be dominant, over native apps), but it has come a long way.</p>

<h3>iA Writer (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id392502056?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id439623248?mt=12">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Whenever I have a thought that I want to remember and ponder later, I write it
down in a note. This usually happens while I am on-the-go. I will then come
back later and review my thoughts and ideas in iA Writer for Mac. I am so thankful
that iA Writer offers syncing through services like iCloud and Dropbox.</p>

<p>I have even been known to write essays on my iPhone of 1000+ words while I walk
between classes, to dinner in Collegetown, and to and from rehearsals. Two of the
three &#8220;A&#8221; papers I wrote last year (one writes few papers when studying engineering)
were written almost entirely in iA Writer for iOS.</p>

<h3>Instapaper (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>After much consideration, I decided to include this app on my list. I have used
Instapaper for many years now, and have truly enjoyed using it. It has,
unforunately, become a repository for articles I&#8217;d like to read, but probably
never will. I found Instapaper very useful, however, to pass the time during
long plane/car/bus rides, as well as long layovers between flights.</p>

<h3>iTerm2 (<a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Almost all of my development before May this year was done in Terminal.app.
While I have appreciated its service, I decided to move on to iTerm2 upon a
recommendation from a friend. iTerm2 is light and doesn&#8217;t have any weird &#8220;Mac
baggage&#8221; which Terminal.app does. It&#8217;s simple to configure (though there are
far too many configuration options, in my opinion), and easy to use.</p>

<h3>Lightroom 4 (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>When I first got my Mac, I bought Apple&#8217;s Aperture to handle photo editing and
management. When Lightroom 1 came out, I gave it a try and really enjoyed how
lightweight it felt. It&#8217;s incredibly easy to use, and its catalogs are quite
small, relative to Aperture&#8217;s. It is easily extendible, with custom plugins
for exporting photos and custom presets for one-click photo editing. I&#8217;ve since
stayed with Lightroom, and never looked back.</p>

<h3>Netflix (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>I have a slight obsession with Star Trek: The Next Generation, and, more
recently, with Star Trek: Voyager. Netflix has been a wonderful means of
distraction when I need to escape to the twenty-fourth century for some R &amp; R.</p>

<h3>Pages (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id361309726?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id409201541?mt=12">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Pages is similar to iA Writer, but built for presentation-geared reports and
papers. If the formatting matters, Pages is there to save the day. I wrote quite
a few lab reports on Pages for iOS.</p>

<h3>Paper (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id361309726?mt=8">iPad</a>)</h3>

<p>Paper by FiftyThree is pretty freakin&#8217; awesome. It&#8217;s incredibly agile, and very
robust. While I am no artist, it&#8217;s great for drawing up a quick website mock-up
and sending it off to colleagues. I am still in search of the right stylus, however
&mdash; I am using the Bamboo stylus from Wacom, but I need a tip which has more
precision for use with Paper. Let me know if you know of one I should pick up.</p>

<h3>Sparrow (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sparrow/id492573565?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sparrow/id417250177?mt=12">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>I have been using Sparrow since its private beta days, and I just love the thing.
Sparrow for Mac is a beaut&#8217; and Sparrow for iOS makes managing my Gmail accounts
so easy and painless, it&#8217;s almost too good to be true.</p>

<h3>Spotify (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotify/id324684580?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="http://www.spotify.com/us/download/mac/">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, I am not made of money, and my bank account resembles that which
one might expect of a poor college student. In my hopes to spend less on music,
I signed up for Spotify and have just loved it. I have discovered several new
artists that I have come to adore (can it get better than some Babyface or Marc
Broussard??), and for that, I am thankful. Spotify for iOS is a bit weird when
trying to initialize radio on a 3G connection, but it&#8217;s something I am willing
to live with for the time being.</p>

<h3>TextMate 2 Alpha (<a href="http://blog.macromates.com/2011/textmate-2-0-alpha/">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>As I mentioned above, I code endlessly. My trusty companion is TextMate 2. In 2006,
<a href="http://blog.dcxn.com">Nick Rowe</a> showed me what would become the text editor to
change my world. After learning all the key bindings, it was hard to switch when
I started learning more about vim. So I stuck with TextMate. When TextMate 2 Alpha
came out, I was never happier. Rebuilt from the ground up, it has all the memory
management I could have hoped for out of TextMate 1. I love this app with all of
my heart.</p>

<h3>Things 2 (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotify/id324684580?mt=8">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things/id407951449?mt=12">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Pretty much the only reason I&#8217;ve been productive this year is due to Things.
I was a beta tester for Things Cloud and Things 2 (both Mac and iOS) and was
delighted to find that this task-management application suite so quickly synced
all of my tasks, and <em>never</em> failed. I&#8217;ve never lost anything with Things Cloud,
and that reliability is important, when it means the difference between getting
someting done, and forgetting about it.</p>

<h3>TuneIn Radio (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tunein-radio-pro-listen-to/id319295332?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>The BBC World Service News station is one that I have grown to love, many thanks
to TuneIn Radio. It gives the user the opportunity to listen to radio stations
being broadcast all around the world &mdash; even in different languages. I have
learned a great deal of German, listening to Deutsche-Welle Nachrichten in this
app. It works beautifully over 3G, too, which makes long car rides all the more
pleasant.</p>

<h3>Tweetbot for (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter-iphone/id428851691?mt=8">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter-ipad/id498801050?mt=8">iPad</a>, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter/id557168941?mt=12">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Last, but certainly not least, I must acknowledge my addiction to Twitter. When
I wake in the morning, I never fail to reach over, grab my iPhone, check my email,
then check my Twitter feed. It usually takes a long breakfast to get through
all of them, but I am able to change devices, due to syncing of my position via
Tweet Marker. Before Tweetbot, I used Twitter for iPhone 3.5.1 (before that horrid
redesign), but really wanted CloudApp support. Tweetbot was the natural alternative
and everyone raved about it. After a couple weeks of using Tweetbot on a daily
basis, I deleted Twitter for iPhone without hesitation. Tweetbot is the best
way to interface with Twitter on any Apple device.</p>

    <updated>2012-12-18T18:33:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.parkermoore.de/2012/12/18/the-immediate-future-of-jekyll</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> is a static blog generator created by <a href="https://github.com/mojombo">Tom Preston-Werner</a>, the
current CEO of <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and one of GitHub&#8217;s co-founders, and by <a href="https://github.com/qrush">Nick Quaranto</a>,
who is now at 37signals. Jekyll is <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites">pretty freakin&#8217; popular</a> and it&#8217;s
also the engine that drives <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<p>After an hour-long chat with Tom, I&#8217;m optimistic about the future of Jekyll. He&#8217;s
really excited about where it&#8217;s headed and has a vision in mind about what he&#8217;d
like it to become.
Here&#8217;s what we ironed out during our conversation:</p>

<p>Led by Tom, a Jekyll development team, of which I&#8217;m the first recruit, will
be tackling the problems with Jekyll and continuously improving its functionality
and ease-of-use. The focus will remain on making a tool that allows one to easily
create and manage a static blog.</p>

<p>Suuuper basic (unofficial) design principles:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep it simple</li>
<li>Easy to extend</li>
<li>Solid safe mode (for GitHub Pages)</li>
</ol>


<p>What we need to tackle:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fix bugs (!!)</li>
<li>Decrease build time (!!)</li>
<li>Docs for site</li>
<li>TomDoc everything</li>
<li>Release new site</li>
<li>Finish same site generator</li>
<li>Include some faster LSI</li>
</ol>


<p>Want to help? Check out the <a href="http://git.io/jekyll-discussion">discussion label</a> and add in your two cents.<br>
Want to contribute code? Check out the <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues">issues</a> and submit a pull request with
a fix.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really excited about the immediate future of Jekyll and what it will become
in the next 6 months or so and the dev team takes on the issues outlined above.
I hope you&#8217;re as excited as we are to get this project back on its feet.</p>

<p>If you want to chat more or have any questions, you know <a href="http://twitter.com/parkr">where to find me</a>.</p>

    <updated>2012-12-12T02:05:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.parkermoore.de/2012/12/12/email-notifications-in-web-apps</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Email notifications from web apps have been annoying us for months now. Ever since Twitter, Facebook and other notification-heavy apps began automatically sending notifications to us (alas, without our consent), public opinion seems to have developed a hatred for email notifications. But, I implore you, understand the flipside:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I really don‚Äôt need your web service to keep another inbox of messages and notifications for me.</p>&mdash; Marco Arment (@marcoarment) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/statuses/278705209507721217">December 12, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://blog.parkermoore.de//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Email notifications in web apps is a way of unifying one&#8217;s virtual &#8220;inbox&#8221;. Dealing with too many is overwhelming.</p>

<p>Keep email notifications around.</p>

<p>(But, for pete&#8217;s sake, <em>ask</em> your users whether they want email notifications before you activate them for their accounts.)</p>

    <link href="http://blog.parkermoore.de/2012/12/11/an-open-letter-to-tom-preston-werner/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-11T17:03:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.parkermoore.de/2012/12/11/an-open-letter-to-tom-preston-werner</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a huge advocate of static site generators and have always favoured <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> as my go-to static site generator.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s fallen out of active development. I&#8217;ve been trying to contact Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo">@mojombo</a>) about it, but so far: nothing. (To be fair, I have gotten two replies, but they were not productive other than saying that he was looking for new maintainers. That was May 2012.)</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s my open letter to you, Tom, about saving   Jekyll from open-source oblivion.</p>

<blockquote><p>Tom,</p>

<p>Hope you had a pleasant weekend.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I wish to see happen with Jekyll:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start an Org on Github and move the Jekyll repo to that org</li>
<li>Add several maintainers to that org (I&#8217;d be happy to help out as a maintainer!)</li>
<li>Add another author or two to the Jekyll gem so that we can gem push and release new versions.</li>
<li>Give at least one other person access to push to the source of jekyllrb.com so that the docs can be updated</li>
</ol>


<p>Problem I&#8217;m trying to solve:</p>

<blockquote><p>Jekyll is incredibly popular and is an incredibly powerful tool, but is not being actively maintained centrally, so though the world around it is evolving, it is staying stagnant and plagued by the same issues it has been for the last four years.</p></blockquote>

<p>Solution:</p>

<blockquote><p>Add maintainers to Jekyll to help deal with issues, push new versions, and update the documentation when you don&#8217;t have the time.</p></blockquote>

<p>The great thing about version control systems is that changes can always be reverted.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your attention to this problem and willingness to help it continue growing.</p>

<p>Warm Regards,<br>
Parker Moore</p></blockquote>

    <link href="http://blog.parkermoore.de/2012/12/11/ia-writer-needs-print-configuration/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-11T16:41:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.parkermoore.de/2012/12/11/ia-writer-needs-print-configuration</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have really adored iA Writer and use the app obsessively on my iPhone, iPad and Mac. It&#8217;s arguably one of my most oft-used apps. I write all sorts of things with the app: blog posts/ideas (like this one), essays, lab reports &#8211; even the occasional code snippet. It&#8217;s my writing tool of choice, and I thank Information Architects for writing such an awesome app.</p>

<p>I also print out a lot of my writing. I like to edit by hand with a pen and paper. I like the beautiful typeface that iA Writer provides and the margins on 8.5&#8221; x 11&#8221; paper (US) are amazing. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed the almost typewriter-like essence of the print-outs which iA Writer provides.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d really love some more configuration options for printing, however. While I will undoubtedly hear the argument that iA Writer offers no configuration <em>on purpose</em>, I will argue that the &#8220;No Configuration Rule&#8221; must only apply to in-app writing, not to the manifestation of this writing in paper form.</p>

<p>The No Configuration Rule is supported by the fact that configuration and modification of the working environment is often a hindrance to one&#8217;s ability to write awesome content. It&#8217;s a distraction. But it&#8217;s a distraction only when <em>writing</em>, not when printing. I&#8217;d say this No Configuration Rule thus can only be justified for writing, i.e. on;y be justified for the look and feel of the writing experience in the app.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s an argument with too many implications. Let&#8217;s make it a bit smaller, to the size of a wish:</p>

<p>My only real wish for this app is to allow double-spaced print-outs. That&#8217;s it. I want to be able to edit my papers double-spaced.</p>

<p>So what say you, Information Architects? Think it&#8217;s possible? I&#8217;d really appreciate it.</p>
