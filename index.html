  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#39;t like being tracked by Web giants when I&#39;m not on their websites. As
more sites integrate Twitter, Facebook, and Google support, I can&#39;t help
but be tracked on almost every site I visit.</p>

<p>Luckily, the integrations for these three aforementioned companies is quite
simple to subvert (at least partially). If you&#39;re running a unix-based
machine, you can add just a few lines to your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file and you&#39;re
well on your way to Web privacy.</p>

<p>Open up a new tab, and open the Developer Console. Open the Network tab.
Now navigate to your favourite blog, news site, etc. You&#39;ll see each
individual network request that is made from that page listed in the
Network pane of the Developer Console. Scroll through requests and make
note of the domain names you wish to block.</p>

<p>Once you have the list of domain names, simply use your <code>hosts</code> file to
reroute those domains to your local server (<code>127.0.0.1</code>). Here&#39;s an example:</p>

<figure class='code-highlight-figure'><div class='code-highlight'><pre class='code-highlight-pre'><div data-line='1' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>127.0.0.1     connect.facebook.net
</div></div><div data-line='2' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>127.0.0.1     google-analytics.com www.google-analytics.com
</div></div><div data-line='3' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>127.0.0.1     platform.twitter.com
</div></div><div data-line='4' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>127.0.0.1     adroll.com a.adroll.com d.adroll.com
</div></div><div data-line='5' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>127.0.0.1     ib.adnxs.com
</div></div><div data-line='6' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>127.0.0.1     googleadservices.com www.googleadservices.com</div></div></pre></div></figure>

<p>In this example, I&#39;ve blocked Facebook, Google Analytics, Twitter, Ad Roll,
Google Ad Services and the unknown &quot;adnxs&quot; service.</p>

<p>Preface each domain name with the address of your local server <code>127.0.0.1</code>
and group each line based on the second-level domain (e.g. <code>adroll.com</code>).
Add each of these lines to your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file (note: this will require
root privileges). Don&#39;t forget to save it when you&#39;re done.</p>

<p>Now navigate to that same site again, with the Network pane still open. You
should now get 404&#39;s or 500&#39;s when you try to access those same domains you
&#39;blocked&#39;.</p>

<p>For a solution that doesn&#39;t require halting access to these hosts, check
out the Tor project.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>TL;DR: Don&#39;t use baseurl. It&#39;ll drive you crazy.</strong></p>

<p>Hey, so there&#39;s been a bit of confusion about what the Jekyll configuration
option called <code>baseurl</code> is. Part of the beauty of open-source and of Jekyll
is that there&#39;s a lot of flexibility. Unfortunately, much of this
flexibility doesn&#39;t apply to <code>baseurl</code>. Here&#39;s a quick distillation of its
intentions, and how to use it.</p>

<h2>Mimic GitHub Pages</h2>

<p><code>baseurl</code> was <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/commit/4a8fc1fa6e3fa5dc05c81ac5ac4ffed0b0818ac4">originally added back in 2010</a> to allow
&quot;the user to test the website with the internal webserver under the same
base url it will be deployed to on a production server&quot;.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> </p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>So let&#39;s say I come up with a cool new project. I want to make
documentation for a project I&#39;m working on called &quot;ubiqity&quot;, and I&#39;ll be
deploying it to GitHub Pages as a repo under my username, &quot;@parkr&quot;. Its
documentation will be available at the URL <code>http://parkr.github.io/ubiquity</code>.</p>

<p>In this example, the term &quot;base URL&quot; refers to <code>ubiquity</code>. When I go to
develop my website, I can set the <code>baseurl</code> key to equal <code>ubiquity</code> and
navigate my website from <code>http://localhost:4000/ubiquity/</code>, as though it
were hosted on GitHub Pages. Notice that the only difference here between
development and production is the host: <code>parkr.github.io</code> vs.
<code>localhost:4000</code>.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2>Configuring Your Site Properly</h2>

<ol>
<li>Set <code>baseurl</code> in your <code>_config.yml</code> to match the production URL without
the host (e.g. <code>ubiquity</code>, <em>not</em> <code>http://parkr.github.io/ubiquity</code>).</li>
<li>Run <code>jekyll serve -w</code> and go to <code>http://localhost:4000/your_baseurl/</code>,
replacing <code>your_baseurl</code> with whatever you set <code>baseurl</code> to in your
<code>_config.yml</code>, and not forgetting the trailing slash.</li>
<li>Make sure everything works. Feel free to prepend your urls with
<code>site.baseurl</code>.</li>
<li>Push up to your host and see that everything works there, too!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Success!</h2>

<p>You&#39;ve done it! You&#39;ve successfully used <code>baseurl</code> and the world is
wonderful.</p>

</li>

<li id="fn2">
<p>The port also differs, but that&#39;s not what&#39;s important here. The point is that everything after the <code>/</code> after the host is the same.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#39;m lucky enough this semester to be taking CS 5300 at Cornell, a class entitled
&quot;The Architecture of Large-Scale Information Systems.&quot; For this class, we will
need to know our way around Amazon&#39;s Web Services. I learned a lot about AWS
when I worked at 6Wunderkinder last year, so I was feeling up to the challenge.
Little did I know that the tooling 6W had created around its ops was far
superior to anything else out there.</p>

<p>I already had an AWS account, so my first step was to find a good CLI. I did the
logical thing, and asked Google. Turns out, Amazon ships its own <code>aws</code> client,
written in Python and shipped via <code>pip</code>. Marvelous! I ran <code>pip install aws</code>,
<code>aws configure</code> and presto, I was in business.</p>

<p>Our first question asked us to launch an instance of the AMI <code>ami-bba18dd2</code>, a
simple Fedora distribution. After asking for the man pages for <code>aws</code> in 6
different ways, I got them. I discovered I would need to specify the instance
type and security group as well. So I created a security group and went ahead:</p>

<figure class='code-highlight-figure'><div class='code-highlight'><pre class='code-highlight-pre'><div data-line='1' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="gp">$ </span>aws ec2 run-instances <span class="se">\</span>
</div></div><div data-line='2' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>  --image-id ami-bba18dd2 <span class="se">\</span>
</div></div><div data-line='3' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>  --instance-type t1.micro <span class="se">\</span>
</div></div><div data-line='4' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>  --security-group-ids sg-sgsga888</div></div></pre></div></figure>

<p>Yay, it worked! Ok, now I need to ssh into this bad boy.</p>

<figure class='code-highlight-figure'><div class='code-highlight'><pre class='code-highlight-pre'><div data-line='1' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="gp">$ </span>ssh ec2-la-la-la.amazonaws.com
</div></div><div data-line='2' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>Access denied <span class="o">(</span>publickey<span class="o">)</span>.</div></div></pre></div></figure>

<p>Huh? What&#39;s that all about? I had created a key pair from previous messing
around with EC2. Hm... After a few minutes of puzzlement, I realized I needed
to pass another option to my <code>aws ec2</code> command. Let&#39;s try this again:</p>

<figure class='code-highlight-figure'><div class='code-highlight'><pre class='code-highlight-pre'><div data-line='1' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="c"># don't forget to terminate old instances!</span>
</div></div><div data-line='2' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="gp">$ </span>aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-1111111
</div></div><div data-line='3' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="c"># now, create the new one</span>
</div></div><div data-line='4' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="gp">$ </span>aws ec2 run-instances <span class="se">\</span>
</div></div><div data-line='5' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>  --image-id ami-bba18dd2 <span class="se">\</span>
</div></div><div data-line='6' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>  --instance-type t1.micro <span class="se">\</span>
</div></div><div data-line='7' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>  --security-group-ids sg-sgsga888 <span class="se">\</span>
</div></div><div data-line='8' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>  --key-name parker</div></div></pre></div></figure>

<p>Booted! Now, let&#39;s try to ssh again:</p>

<figure class='code-highlight-figure'><div class='code-highlight'><pre class='code-highlight-pre'><div data-line='1' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="gp">$ </span>ssh ec2-li-la-le.amazonaws.com
</div></div><div data-line='2' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>Access denied <span class="o">(</span>publickey<span class="o">)</span>.</div></div></pre></div></figure>

<p>Bollocks! Looks like I am still missing something...</p>

<p>Ah! After taking a look at a tutorial, I realize I need to login as <code>ec2-user</code>.
Let&#39;s give this one more try:</p>

<figure class='code-highlight-figure'><div class='code-highlight'><pre class='code-highlight-pre'><div data-line='1' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="gp">$ </span>ssh ec2-user@ec2-li-la-le.amazonaws.com

<p>YES! I did it. Ok, so lessons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Login as <code>ec2-user</code>, not as <code>albie</code> or any other name.</li>
<li>Make sure you specify the <code>key-name</code> for the instance(s) you want to launch.</li>
<li>Always err on the side of being more specific. Defaults can be bad.</li>
<li>Always terminate once you&#39;re done using the box.</li>
</ol>

<p>Simple fixes for problems that seem so intractible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was fortunate enough to, just today, pick up a new computer. My first hardware
in over 4 years, I had been holding off. Once my trusty MacBook Pro bit the dust
last night and I found out the repair cost was extraordinary, I bit the bullet.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;re probably in a similar place. You relatively recently got a shiny new
Macintosh and you&#39;re so excited to start writing code and making a difference
with those skillz of yours. Except one this is missing: <a href="https://github.com/wincent/Command-T">Command-T</a>.</p>

<p>Lucky for you, sir, I am here to help. OS X Maverick&#39;s built-in vim distribution
comes with Ruby support already (which it needs for Command-T) so you&#39;re good
there. Now you need to download and compile Command-T. Should be easy, right?
Well, not quite.</p>

<p>Mavericks was notable for Ruby users because it ships with Ruby 2.0. All
previous versions that I had ever used shipped with 1.8.7 so this was a huge
bonus. Problem is, your pre-installed vim wasn&#39;t compiled with 2.0.0, it was
compiled with 1.8.7.</p>

<p>To check this, run the following in vim in NORMAL mode:</p>

<figure class='code-highlight-figure'><div class='code-highlight'><pre class='code-highlight-pre'><div data-line='1' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>:ruby puts "#{RUBY_VERSION}-p#{RUBY_PATCHLEVEL}"</div></div></pre></div></figure>

<p>For me, that output <code>1.8.7-p358</code>. So that means the Ruby verison that vim is
using is <code>1.8.7-p358</code>, and we need to compile Command-T with that version. To do
so, install it:</p>

<figure class='code-highlight-figure'><div class='code-highlight'><pre class='code-highlight-pre'><div data-line='1' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="gp">$ </span>rbenv install 1.8.7-p358</div></div></pre></div></figure>

<p>Boom! Now download and install Command-T:</p>

<figure class='code-highlight-figure'><div class='code-highlight'><pre class='code-highlight-pre'><div data-line='1' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="gp">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/wincent/Command-T.git ~/.vim/bundle/Command-T
</div></div><div data-line='2' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/.vim/bundle/Command-T <span class="c"># for tpope's Pathogen</span>
</div></div><div data-line='3' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="gp">$ </span>rbenv <span class="nb">local </span>1.8.7-p358
</div></div><div data-line='4' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="gp">$ </span>rbenv rehash
</div></div><div data-line='5' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="gp">$ </span>gem install bundler
</div></div><div data-line='6' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="gp">$ </span>bundle install
</div></div><div data-line='7' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'><span class="gp">$ </span>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>rake make</div></div></pre></div></figure>

<p>Aaaaand boom, you&#39;re done. Open up <code>vim</code> and type your leaderkey then <code>t</code> (for
me, that&#39;s <code>,t</code>) to launch the prompt.</p>

<p>If you get a weird SIGTERM error when you launch <code>vim</code>, then you installed
Command-T with the wrong Ruby version. Remove <code>ruby/command-t/ext.bundle</code> and
try again.</p>

<p>I decided, for cost&#39;s sake, to boot up one of those famed $5 <a href="https://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>
Droplets. I didn&#39;t see that DigitalOcean provides an &quot;app&quot; for Dokku, so I
created a vanilla box of Ubuntu 13.04 and pressed on. I got everything up and
running and went to go deploy my first app, only to see this when I ran
<code>git push</code>:</p>

<figure class='code-highlight-figure'><div class='code-highlight'><pre class='code-highlight-pre'><div data-line='1' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>runtime: panic before malloc heap initialized
</div></div><div data-line='2' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>fatal error: runtime: cannot allocate heap metadata</div></div></pre></div></figure>

<p>Well, golly, that sure is unhelpful. Looks like 512MB doesn&#39;t cut it. Luckily,
we can avoid paying the extra $5/mo for the 1GB version by running the following
as <code>root</code>:</p>

<figure class='code-highlight-figure'><div class='code-highlight'><pre class='code-highlight-pre'><div data-line='1' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>dd <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/zero <span class="nv">of</span><span class="o">=</span>/extraswap <span class="nv">bs</span><span class="o">=</span>1M <span class="nv">count</span><span class="o">=</span>512
</div></div><div data-line='2' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>mkswap /extraswap</div></div></pre></div></figure>

<p>Then adding the following to your <code>/etc/fstab</code> file so the swap persists between
reboots:</p>

<figure class='code-highlight-figure'><div class='code-highlight'><pre class='code-highlight-pre'><div data-line='1' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>/extraswap         none            swap    sw                0       0</div></div></pre></div></figure>

<p>Then run this to enable <code>/extraswap</code> for swapping:</p>

<figure class='code-highlight-figure'><div class='code-highlight'><pre class='code-highlight-pre'><div data-line='1' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>swapon -a</div></div></pre></div></figure>

<p>Boom. Now re-run <code>git push</code> and you&#39;re in business. Magic!</p>

<p>Credit goes to the brilliant <a href="https://github.com/dhassler">@dhassler</a> for <a href="https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues/1555#issuecomment-22874190">the idea and the code</a>. Just
thought I&#39;d share and preserve for my own benefit in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last December (2012), <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com">Tom Preston-Werner</a> granted me <a href="/images/mojombo-added-parkr-to-jekyll.png">push &amp; pull access to
mojombo/jekyll</a>. I had written a <a href="/2012/12/11/an-open-letter-to-tom-preston-werner/">letter to Tom about the future of Jekyll</a>
and after a bit of persistence on my part, he relented:</p>

<p><img src="/images/mojombo-added-parkr-to-jekyll.png" alt="mojombo added parkr to mojombo/jekyll"></p>

<p>After a somewhat lengthy (and <a href="/images/jekyll-shall-inherit-the-earth.png">amusing</a>) conversation via Skype, I knew what
Tom&#39;s priorities were for the project and where I could help. I started off
trimming down the number of open issues. At the time, they numbered just over 300.
After a quick visit to Buffalo to tackle some issues with <a href="http://quaran.to">Nick Quaranto</a> at a
Buffalo <a href="http://openhack.github.io">OpenHack</a> meetup at <a href="http://coworkbuffalo.com">CoworkBuffalo</a>, we were down to fewer than 200
open issues. I continued to work through them (much to my parents&#39; dismay) all
through Winter Break. I was making good progress in the triage process: I knew
what many of the problems were with v0.12.1 and was formulating ideas about how
we might go about fixing them.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jekyll-shall-inherit-the-earth.png" alt="jekyll shall inherit the earth"></p>

<p>In January, I flew out to San Francisco to visit my sister for a week. I setup a
meeting with Tom to talk more about Jekyll and a plan for moving forward to a
v1.0.0 release. After about an hour or so at GitHub&#39;s office in SoMa, talking
through various PR&#39;s, Tom said I could start merging pull requests.</p>

<p>Consultation with Tom was challenging (he runs a multi-million dollar company
after all), as it was increasingly difficult for him to find time for Jekyll.
Despite <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/578#issuecomment-11414645">announcing that he was going to commit some of his &quot;20% time&quot; to Jekyll</a>,
he eventually abandoned that as impractical. As time went on, I received fewer
replies to my emails and eventually stopped sending anything that didn&#39;t
absolutely <em>require</em> Tom&#39;s input.</p>

<p>In March, I knew I needed more help. Tom wasn&#39;t able to give much time and I
was trying to tackle this project alone. I had noticed that <a href="http://mattr.info">Matt Rogers</a>
shared my vision for Jekyll, so I asked Tom to add him on as a contributor to
the repo. By v1.0.3, he had started merging pull requests like a BAW$ and was
the sanity to my ridiculously-obsessed, inexperienced mind. Since Matt joined, I
haven&#39;t really heard much from Tom. I write the occasional email and get the
occasional reply but he&#39;s essentially phased out of the normal development of
Jekyll. Matt &amp; I have essentially taken over the project altogether.</p>

<p>By May, we were ready to ship v1.0.0. With the help of all the amazing
contributors, Matt, and my many mentors along the way, I finally ran
<code>rake release</code> for 1.0. The project was ours.</p>

<p>Since realizing that this product has few constraints outside of those I&#39;ve
constructed for it in my mind (no one is going to tell me, &quot;No, you may not
implement that feature or add that enhancement&quot; without a valid argument as to
my solution&#39;s invalidity), I&#39;ve been thinking about what it means to take over
someone else&#39;s project. <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/commit/d189e05d236769c1e5594af9db4d6eacb86fc16e">Jekyll is 5 years old.</a> I wasn&#39;t there in 2008 when
it was first born as <code>autoblog</code>. Jekyll has changed a lot, as has its vision and
purpose. It&#39;s used by lots of people now, whether via <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> or
locally.</p>

<p>Taking over someone else&#39;s project takes a deep understanding of what the
project is and what it should be. As much as I wish Jekyll could make me
kräuterquark, that&#39;s outside the scope of the project. Developing that lens is
crucial when taking over someone else&#39;s project.</p>

<p>Mentoring on the part of the original owner/previous maintainer(s) is
exceedingly significant in the development of this critical lens. I am so
grateful that I was able to meet up with Tom back in January and to have some
amount of input from him as I understood what the project should be.</p>

<p>It would be ill-advised to take over someone else&#39;s project without a partner.
Once Matt joined the team, Tom was able to step back into a much lesser role.
If I had tried to do what I did without any guidance (or at least sanity
checks), Jekyll v1.0.0 would have been a complete shit-show.</p>

<p>Trust in the community must also be earned. If people highly doubted my ability
to handle Jekyll, Tom would have likely removed me and found a replacement. I
argued a lot and got into some pretty heated debates at the beginning. There
were a couple people who didn&#39;t share the vision that I had inherited from Tom
and stopped contributing to the project altogether. I feel like we now have a
pretty great community around Jekyll and are able to help each other out and
share cool plugins and sites that we made for/with Jekyll.</p>

<p>Taking over someone else&#39;s open-source project was new terrain for me in
December, and still is today. It can be successful with the right amount of
mentoring and gradual removal of trusted feedback by the previous maintainer(s).</p>

<p>With some old projects that are brought back to life by the passing of the
torch, the new maintainers are able to experience the added bonus of feeling
like Frankenstein, which, I will say, is a pretty cool feeling.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>The following post was first written for a class at Cornell University taught
by Phoebe Sengers called &quot;Designing Technologies for Social Impact&quot;.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>We have a rather significant problem in the U.S. Indeed, our government seems to
be malfunctioning in a rather obvious and irresponsible way. The question of
today is simply: can it be fixed? If so, how?</p>

<p>One must first examine the problem and its root cause. The problem of
malfunction is most basically the conflict of multiple competing interests
without proper ideological or procedural basis for dialogue. The root cause of
this is that the existing platforms for dialogue (meetings, letters, rallies,
news spots) are severely outdated. What worked pre-internet is not passing the
test of time.</p>

<p>In particular, the legislative process is slow, dilapidated, and closed. This
leads to laws with earmarks and loopholes, confusing language and unnecessary
provisions. What if the law were made out in the open, for everyone to see, the
way open-source software is made? Version control and online access to bills
in-the-works as well as laws would certainly improve transparency. The Library
of Congress runs a system called THOMAS which is updated about daily, but the
bills aren&#39;t organized logically and the user interface is fair at best.</p>

<p>The open-source legislation system envisioned here is based on an open-source
software system called GitHub. GitHub is setup like so: users and organizations
own repositories of code, text or binary documents. Each repository contains the
entire history of a particular set of documents as well as the &quot;master&quot; version,
or the latest repository-owner(s)-approved version of the document(s). Each
repository uses a version control system called git to keep track of the
information about the documents it contains: current versions as well as
previous versions. What is unique about this system, and the incredible strength
it offers for open legislation, is the concept of a &quot;diff&quot;. A &quot;diff&quot; is simply
the difference between a document at one point in time (referred to as a
&quot;revision&quot;) and the same document at a different point in time. Each repository
can be &quot;forked&quot; (cloned to a user&#39;s own profile for editing) by a user; this
offers the most significant freedom of open-source, which is that anyone has the
freedom to modify a copy of the source and suggest changes to the main project
based on those derivative works. In GitHub parlance, the suggestion for a change
is called a &quot;pull request,&quot; but this term need not be adopted by this new
system.</p>

<p>To illustrate the design of the ideal system:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use git derivative for prose editing, rather than (line-by-line) code editing</li>
<li>Be online, accessible by anyone</li>
<li>Offer input from anyone in any form (suggested changes or just comments)</li>
<li>Do not make differentiation between users other than repository owner &amp;
non-owner (those with direct access to the repository and those who can fork
and suggest changes, but can&#39;t incorporate those changes themselves)</li>
<li><p>Each repository is a proposed bill owned by the deciding body at the given
time during the legislative process as dictated by the U.S. Constitution.
Each repository contains a text file for each sub-segment of the proposed
bill as well as a rationale or goal, e.g.
 . (root)
 |
 |-- README.txt (rationale, goal(s) of bill, and other meta info)
 |-- section01.txt
 |-- section02.txt
 |
 ...</p></li>
<li><p>The entire process of the creation and formulation of the law is public and
open insofar as the culture can push for this</p></li>
<li><p>Moderator of some sort to ensure comments are productive (usually repo
owner). All of the comments that are hidden still exist inline and can be
shown by any reader of the comment thread</p></li>
<li><p>Membership of individual lawmakers in committees and other larger bodies
reflected in membership of organization accounts on the platform, which gives
them access to directly changing the legislation they have access to through
their organizational memberships</p></li>
<li><p>Offer &quot;points of interest&quot; as a means of discussion about a particular aspect
of a bill without the need to suggest changes. Can ask anything from &quot;why is
this section worded this way?&quot; to &quot;what are the implications of this on
agricultural development in Upstate New York?&quot; No question is too dumb and
all of them require an answer insofar as they are productive and relevant.</p></li>
<li><p>Easy citation of preexisting laws and other bills to allow for discussion
surrounding conflict or other interference</p></li>
<li><p>Access to signing letters written by President (usually interpretations of
pieces of the law for purposes of execution of the law)</p></li>
<li><p>Easy viewing of votes on final versions of bills (who, when, did it pass?,
etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Means of mentioning lawmakers in a comment if comment is directed at them,
or question is asked directly of them</p></li>
<li><p>Links to more information about execution by Executive &amp; other related
policy/law</p></li>
<li><p>Comments and changes can only be created from user accounts, e.g. David
Skorton can suggest a change, but Cornell University cannot.</p></li>
<li><p>Users can subscribe to updates from a bill repository and receive all
information about changes that are made and discussions that occur.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>One negative aspect of this approach is volume and the issues that come
therefrom (see: student&#39;s answer on Piazza page linked to below). As the number
of collaborators grows, the ability for those with direct access to the bills to
handle suggestions for modification is greatly diminished. How are the interests
of the few vs. those of the many weighed (e.g. individual comment vs comment from
organization such as NAACP)? From the perspective of the way government works
already, aides of the legislators who have access to the repositories will also
have mirrored access to accept and discuss changes and questions from citizens.
As each law is its own repository, the load is distributed over the many
hundreds of bill repositories being considered. Additionally, Nissenbaum &amp;
Benkler discuss the idea of self-selection and volunteerism as an element of
open-source. This applies very much so to the scalability of open-source
legislation and responses to citizens. If a citizen is not interested in a
particular bill, that citizen will not involve himself or herself with the
creation of that bill. This self-selection will greatly reduce the number of
individuals with whom the maintainers of the bills will have to contend with in
discussion about a bill and suggestions for change.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this idea is predicated on the idea that citizens, when given the
right tools, can reach compromise and have productive discussions to &quot;get the
job done&quot; efficiently and accurately.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post was <a href="http://2450fall2013.ning.com/groups/red-2450/blog/it-s-just-semantics-app-net-alpha">originally written</a> as an assignment for <a href="http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=12&amp;coid=90680">INFO 2450: Communication
&amp; Technology</a> taught by Professors <a href="http://infosci.cornell.edu/faculty/jeffrey-hancock">Jeff Hancock</a> and <a href="http://communication.cals.cornell.edu/people/drew-margolin">Drew Margolin</a> in
Fall 2013. The course focuses heavily on design of technologies. The assignment
asked for an evaluation of an online application or product based on the
principles outlined in Donald Norman&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0465067107">&quot;The Design of Everyday Things&quot;</a>. It&#39;s
a very basic look at the technology, but I thought I&#39;d share it anyhow.</p>

<hr>

<p>App.net is a social platform designed from the beginning to be nothing more than
a platform for developers to build great social apps upon. This blog post will
be about the very first application built upon App.net, called Alpha. App.net
will henceforth be referred to as &quot;ADN.&quot;</p>

<p>The main purpose of Alpha is to demonstrate the ADN API in a somewhat familiar
way. Alpha behaves much the way Twitter does: a user creates posts, users can
follow other users and interact with them in the familiar way. The divergence
from Twitter (and other &quot;microblogging&quot; social applications) is twofold: a user
pays for his or her account, and the posts may be longer.</p>

<p>By asking the user to pay for an ADN account (which is used by Alpha as the
poster&#39;s identity), the normal business incentives shift from building an
application (or platform) which optimizes for advertisement revenue to an
application (or platform) which optimizes for the happiness of the user (if
users like to use the service, they will continue to pay the $5/month or
$32/year). Twitter, Facebook, and Google are well-known for accepting user
detriment (in terms of the virtual design of the products) for greater
advertisement revenue. This is not the case with ADN (and by extension, with
Alpha).</p>

<p>On Alpha, posts may be up to 256 characters long and users can choose to attach
media to their posts. The &quot;@&quot; symbol is used to mention another user (the other
user receives a notification when this happens) and the &quot;#&quot; is used to denote
topics. With the longer character limit, one could easily surmise that Alpha is
attempting to make having asynchronous, open conversations online a bit easier.
The openness of being able to write anyone (divergence from Facebook) coupled
with the 256 character limit (a physical constraint) (divergence from Facebook,
and extension of Twitter&#39;s idea that a post should be &quot;bite-sized&quot;) produce a
fantastic application for having chats with anyone about anything in a way
conducive to conciseness and to expressiveness. One common frustration with
Twitter is that conversations on it are very challenging, as 140 characters is
far too few to really say anything substantive. ADN hopes to remedy this
problem, and in my experience, arguments (and general discussions, for that
matter) have been incredibly easy and productive.</p>

<p><img src="/images/app-net/app-net-alpha-feed.png" alt="Screenshot of alpha.app.net"></p>

<p>Above, you see the home screen of Alpha (namely, mine). This shows the user&#39;s
stream. The search box and post box (based on their physical attributes) afford
writing. The change of the &quot;POST&quot; button from grey to a nice deep red-orange
highlights a change of the mapping from a button that may not be pressed to one
that may be pressed (I would consider the change itself feedback). As the user
types in a post, the number (shown here as &quot;256&quot;) decreases by one for each
character that is typed into the box above it, providing very valuable feedback
about the user&#39;s actions. This number&#39;s presence also provides visibility for
the physical constraint placed on the size of the posts allowed in the service.
The buttons on the right of each post afford clicking and change color
(feedback) when clicked. All of the aforementioned design elements, in addition
to the placement of the post box at the top, suggest that the application is
trying to get the user to submit content to his or her stream. The feed below
seems to indicate that the application wishes for perusal and interaction of
other users&#39; posts by the logged-in user.</p>

<p><img src="/images/app-net/app-net-alpha-post.png" alt="Screenshot of a singular post"></p>

<p>As you saw above, each post is given its own box. There are 5 interactions which
only show up when the user mouses-over the post: &quot;Discussion,&quot; &quot;Reply,&quot; &quot;via
(app),&quot; &quot;Mute User,&quot; and &quot;Report&quot;. In order to better facilitate the app&#39;s goal
of interaction, it would make sense for the &quot;Discussion&quot; and &quot;Reply&quot; buttons to
always be shown. This would improve the visibility of the interaction paradigms
and afford interaction without the user making the first move (to mouseover).</p>
