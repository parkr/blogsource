In the middle and upper classes of western society (let's be specific), information overload is a common theme. Our iPhones connect us to the Internet when we're away from our computers and send us notifications to distract us during every activity.

Most of us endure information overload every day. It has been recognized in psychological and sociological circles as harmful to the individual and the society. So, how do we fight back?

First, turn off push notifications and automatic fetching of new emails, updates, etc. This will allow you to deal with the influx at your leisure and when you are mentally prepared to do so. 

Second, cut back on the number of blogs, feeds, etc. to which you subscribe. Only subscribe to those to which you really and truly enjoy listening and from which you receive valuable information. Additionally, remove redundancies. No one likes seeing the same post twice.

Third, limit your social network activity. Don't be constantly updating your Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Path, Pinterest, etc. feeds. Also, don't read these feeds too often. Cut back on the number of people you follow. Don't think you need to follow that new random person who just followed you, because you don't. And they're probably just spam anyway.

Fourth, privatize. Make your content private. This way, you're only sharing things that you think your friends/ colleagues/ family, etc. will be interested in and that which you find interesting. Nothing superfluous. "Ah, someone might care," should never be thought.

Fifth, read books or spend long periods of time doing something that requires great focus. This may help enhance your focus, and will definitely help you feel calmer. Read something for pleasure.

Sixth, hang out with friends, sans technologie. Pretty straightforward.

So that's a start. Do those things and any feelings of being overwhelmed by information overload should either dissipate or be made less significant.
