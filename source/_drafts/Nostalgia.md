Nostalgia

I hate nostalgia. I have never yearned for the past, never wished I could have something from the past back. I am forward-thinking, and much prefer this more practical outlook on life: plan ahead.

What really gets me is the "Well, thanks for everything, 2011. Hope 2012 is just as a good or better." it's cute and all, but I did it repulsive and annoying. The state of affairs in not only our country, but also in our world is somewhat sour and unpleasant. Millions die every year for reasons that can be prevented: AIDS, malnutrition, lack of access to (quality) healthcare. All of these are preventable, and yet they still plague us. 2011 was an awful year for the world, and especially for the United States of America, which, if you're keeping up with the news, has politicians looking like complete and total idiots, issuing statements that are completely wrong-headed and bigoted. And 2011 was a good year? Perhaps for you, personally or professionally, but surely not the world.

We have this habit, a contrived obligation to "thank" the year previous for what it brought to us, as though the events of 2011 could not have happened in any other year. It annoys the hell out of me.

If you wish to reflect on the year previous, please keep it to _self-reflection_. I, nor anyone else, do not care about your year. We're not your family or close friends. We absolutely couldn't care less. How conceited are we to believe that others give even an iota of energy to care about our year? Sharing your reflections is not productive and pisses me the hell off. Please stop it.

Nostalgia has its time and place. EVERY SINGLE NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATION is not one of them. Bugger off. Thanks.
