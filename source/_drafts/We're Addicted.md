We're Addicted

We're addicted: to our Facebook and Twitter feeds, to our electronics, to our electronic reading. We're addicted to sharing. The appeal of sharing the small and otherwise inconsequential moments in our lives has grown to such a degree that my generation, Generation-Y, is so used to sharing our whole lives, that it is somewhat second nature now to tweet every thought and post every silly photo we have ever taken.

This pervasive sharing has consequences, however. When I go to look for a job, will my twitter account hinder my chance

Also, we have become rather narcissistic. We believe that people actually _want_ to read about every tiny occurrence in our tiny little lives. How true is this belief? Completely untrue. My friends do not care about small, not-so-special events that occur in my life. So why do I feel the need to tell them? In my case, I like the idea of archiving my experiences for my own uses, and If twitter already has the infrastructure setup, why should I bother creating my own proprietary version myself? My friends can live with my archive and unfollow if they're not interested.

Is sharing to this extent just an ego boost? It seems to be far beyond a wish to tell someone about something. I believe I share because I want other to react positively to whatever it is I have shared and accept me further for it. Somehow, I have mangled my own self-acceptance with Facebook and Teitter. I no longer look for self-acceptance; rather, I look for acceptance from others.

It's really strange, this highly pervasive social society in which we live. What do you think?
