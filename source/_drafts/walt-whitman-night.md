excerpt: Walt Whitman's words leave me feeling quite happy.
---

I picked up some [Walt Whitman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman) poems yesterday at the library at the recommendation of a friend. I expected to enjoy [what I read][1], but ne'er thought I would absolutely _crave_ it. Lo and behold, that is what it has turned out to be: a true love story between a man and another man's poetry.

I will use tonight's post to archive some excerpts I particularly enjoy. I will not attempt to explain or analyze them; that's for you to do.

> I am satisfied&mdash;I see, dance, laugh, sing;<br>
> As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side<br>
> > through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the<br>
> > day with stealthy tread,<br>
> Leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels swelling<br>
> > the house with their plenty,<br>
> Shall I postpone my acception and realization and<br>
> > scream at my eyes,<br>
> That they turn from gazing after and down the road,<br>
> And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,<br>
> Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two,<br>

> I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;itself to you,<br>
> And you must not be abased to the other.<br>
> <span class="source-page">(p. 16)</span>

I expect to post more excerpts as I continue through the book. For now, good night.
