I was just reading Dustin Curtis's blog post about ["The Gap"][thegap] and scrolled to the bottom after reading the post. Despite being an incredibly brilliant post -- one that mimics my own discomfort at not being able to achieve to my standards, though not in design -- I was far more fascinated by his "Life Counter". Particularly, it was striking to see that Dustin had given himself a projected time of death, measured in days, hours, minutes and seconds he has left. He has an accompanying "life progress bar", that stated, at the time of writing this post, that Dustin's life was "34% complete". 

I clicked the link to read article #5, his "About" page. [There][about], I found an even more striking view of what it could be.

It put my life into a new perspective for me. I decided to look up my expected time of death. It is 74 years old. As a little bit of a web developer myself (ha, this will be my future career), I put together a little life counter below. It has definitely put things into perspective for me. 

I will die in <span id="lifecounter">0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, and 0 seconds</span> at the age of 74.
