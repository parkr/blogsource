title: Getting Busy At Cornell
categories: cornell story education
---

I've been at [Cornell][cornell] for a little over a week and I can honestly admit I've never been this busy. Thanks to my time at McGill, I have been able to manage my time well, but this is a new level of busy for me!

Coursework has been relatively do-able; I've had 3 assignments and 7 readings to do. All in all, not too bad for 3 days of classes. Judging from what I know at this moment, [**CS2110**][cs2110] is probably going to be the most work. Much of the theory behind the algorithms and mathematical problems is new to me and I suspect that will be the most difficult aspect of this class. [**INFO1300**][info1300] (Intro to Web Design), if I can't obtain an exemption from the course, will be a cinch. I really don't expect any issues with that class at all. [**INFO 2040**][info2040] will be lots of work, but the concepts we're learning don't seem too difficult to grasp. It's also a huge class, so there's plenty of opportunity to ask questions to others. It has a good reputation, too. [**EDUC2710**][educ2710] is already turning out to be one of my favourite classes. Going to be a _lot_ of work, but it'll be worth it. I was recently given permission to enroll in [**CS4999**][cs4999], a class where I conduct research and write web apps for college credit. All in all, a good deal.

Cornell offers wonderful academics, but I would argue that the extracurricular opportunities rival those in the academic world. I have chosen to get involved in the music scene here, having been accepted into the [Cornell Glee Club][gleeclub] just last night! A Cappella auditions are this week, and I'm still working on those. I'm also hoping to get involved with the [Cornell Daily Sun][cornellsun] as a web developer. There are a couple other clubs I'm looking into, but those are sort of on hold while auditions ensue.

In addition to all of this, I am a free-lance web developer/designer. I'm really excited to continue my Cornell experience. It's amazing here and I don't want to waste even one minute. Let's end in song:

>	Far above Cayuga's waters,<br />
>	With its waves of blue,<br />
>	Stands our noble Alma Mater,<br />
>	Glorious to view.<br />
>	<br />
>	Lift the chorus, speed it onward,<br />
>	Loud her praises tell;<br />
>	Hail to thee, our Alma Mater!<br />
>	Hail, all hail, Cornell!<br />
>	<br />
>	Far above the busy humming<br />
>	Of the bustling town,<br />
>	Reared against the arch of heaven,<br />
>	Looks she proudly down.<br />
>	<br />
>	Lift the chorus, speed it onward,<br />
>	Loud her praises tell;<br />
>	Hail to thee, our Alma Mater!<br />
>	Hail, all hail, Cornell!
	
I look forward to sharing more with you about Cornell and my experiences here.
