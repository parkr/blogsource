Negativity in open-source is easily on of its most fundamental flaws. Most who are active in the open-source community acknowledge this. If a newcomer to open-source contributes a patch and is chastised, insulted or belittled for the contribution, they will likely never come back. If a maintainer responds to a feature request or bug report only to get a nasty, entitled response in return, they may become discouraged and the development velocity of the project may suffer as a result.

But negativity has a detrimental effect on closed-source development, too. Imagine submitting a pull request for a new feature or a bug fix and receiving dismissive and condescending comments from colleagues. Or, perhaps even worse, a colleague simply closes your pull request without much consideration at all. This leads to a spiteful and wholly unmotivating work environment, where developers work merely for the money, not because they are excited about the product they are building and the team with whom they are building it.
