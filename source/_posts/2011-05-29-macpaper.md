excerpt: So here's my idea for a Mac Instapaper client.
---

One day, I decided I was going to try my hand in some Objective-C. I didn't have any idea _what_ I was going to create, only that it had to be useful. I pride myself on my love for utilities that help people out. What came out of it was this.

## Concept

I had recently signed up for [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) by [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org) and decided that I would make a Cocoa app for Instapaper. Instead of having to log onto the website, you could launch this application and do everything you can do on the site, but natively and more beautifully right in the app.

## Changes

I now think _Macpaper_ should be a menubar application... like everything else. I could see a [CloudApp](http://www.getcloudapp.com)-like approach, where clicking an item would open it up in the browser. At the recommendation of a friend, [Nick Paulson](http://nickpaulson.com), I purchased the book [Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X (Third Edition) by Aaron Hillegass](http://cl.ly/79AH "Aaron's book on Amazon.com"). I'll read through this bad-boy and code the rest, hopefully by the end of the summer.
