Today, I'm proud to announce that I have accepted a job offer from [Visual Supply Co][],
a small and happenin' start-up based in the Bay Area. Visual Supply Co,
also known as VSCO, produces the well-loved [VSCO Cam][] iPhone
and Android apps, as well as [VSCO Film][], [VSCO Grid][], and [VSCO Keys][].
I'll be working on all things web, including the Grid service and the API.

Super stoked to begin this next chapter in my journey through life working
on a slick series of products with a stellar team. Follow my adventure on
[my grid][]!
