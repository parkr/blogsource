The simple acoustic guitar melody plays in the background as "Aaron Swartz,
1986-2013" flashes onto the screen. The moment is a serene one.

I have just finished a documentary film called "The Internet's Own Boy: The
Story of Aaron Swartz," a story of the man who found his calling in
liberating crucial information from the shackles of copyright, censorship,
and classification. The film begins with the story of how Aaron's parents
discovered his incredible talents and wonderful mind.

The story continues
with the way in which Aaron became involved in the Internet, helping found
Internet companies, movements, and even very actively participating in the
discussions around the creation of RSS and other standards. His brother
recalls when 14-year-old Aaron came to him with the initial drafts of RSS,
each word displaying his characteristic enthusiasm. Aaron was completely
enveloped by the discussions he was having with the standards body members.
He was able to match the swift intelligence and linguistic cunning of men
and women much older than himself and quickly developed a reputation as
being someone to take seriously. He was a prodigy.

He spent a year at Stanford, and immediately developed a distaste for its
role as a "babysitting program for overachieving highschoolers."
