excerpt: Working with others is awesome. Sometimes.

Coding has turned out to be a huge part of my life this summer. From working with [Leacock's](http://www.leacocks.com/) to familiarizing myself with the technologies the [Cornell Daily Sun](http://www.cornellsun.com) uses to get ready for this fall at Cornell, I have probably been spending six to ten hours per day buried in code. On days off from my day job, I probably spend even _more_ time typing away. I am not complaining, in fact, it feels a little like bragging. I have coded for fun since the wee age of 12. Only recently have I begun, however, to collaborate on code and design.

Leacock's has been a great learning experience with regard to collaborative website creation. Having limits (though they are few and far between) is both confining and liberating; consequently, they help me produce more robust and beautiful code, because I will plan more, so as to make sure those limits have been met. I really enjoy working with these guys &mdash; the designs are absolutely gorgeous and, best of all, both of my "bosses" are responsive.

On the opposite hand, I've dealt with a couple people this year who have been very slow to respond to my messages. Not only is this not productive, it's also quite frustrating. I've learned recently to be more proactive about expressing the imperative for quick responses and being quick to respond to emails coming my way too, as a "meet me halfway" sort of gesture. For some, it worked. For others, I'm still waiting.

_I sure hope this isn't what the real world is like._<br>Good thing I have three more years of college left!
