I was recently cleaning out my room at home (I'm back from college for the summer) and found an old `git` cheat-sheet. I thought I would electronically log it for future reference (as though I don't use git every day or something...).

```bash
git init
git clone git://github.com/username/repo.git
git add filename
git status [-s]
git diff [--cached] [HEAD] [--stat]
git commit [-a] [-m "commit message"]
git reset [HEAD]
git rm [--cached] filename
	# (by adding --cached, the file that's deleted
	# will be left in your local directory)

git branch branchname
git checkout branchname
git checkout -b branchname
git branch -d branchname # (delete)

git merge branchname # (merges 'branchname' to current branch)
git mv file newfile
git log [--oneline] [--graph] [branchname] [^compared_branch_name]
git tag -a msg commit_shortcode

git remote [-v]
git remote add alias git@github.com:username/repo.git
git fetch alias
```
