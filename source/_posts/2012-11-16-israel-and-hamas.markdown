You may have heard about the recent eruption of violence in Israel and the 
Gaza Strip. You may have your opinions set, but just hear me out.

So the way the story goes is that Gaza has been firing lots of rockets
into Israel and Israel has decided to retaliate by firing its own rockets
and otherwise bombarding the Gaza Strip with explosives. So, fire and fire
are at work here.

This is wrong. Hamas (the current leaders of Gaza) is wrong and Israel is
wrong. There is nothing morally justifiable about what either party is doing.

Many have expressed sympathy with Israel and an acquaintance of mine even
posted [a video produced by the Israel Defense Forces about why it has the
right to retaliate]() on Facebook. There is absolutely no "right" to kill
anyone. No one can justifiably kill anyone else.

Enter: moral excusability. While killing another human being is _never_ morally
justifiable, it is often viewed as morally excusable. That is, it is not 
_right_ to kill another human being, but it isn't wrong (given the circumstances)
either. Well, that's bullshit. If something isn't morally justifiable, don't do
it.

This eye-for-an-eye thing is getting out of hand. Both parties need to stop
hurting each other and begin discussing what can be done to peacefull coexist.
Unless Israel kills all the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, there will never
be peace. Unfortunately, it seems like their hawkish Prime Minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, is just about ready to kill off every non-Israeli in the Gaza Strip.

This whole situation is just despicable.
