I can't decide whether this semester was a success or a failure. There are so many things about which I should be proud, and an almost equal number of things about which I should be ashamed or disappointed. 

I'll start with the good news first. Right as the semester began, I was accepted into the Cornell University Glee Club and The Class Notes. I am very proud to be a member of both groups and have found the members of each group to be kind, considerate, and, most of all, accepting. We have made some beautiful music this semester, and I am especially excited to compete with the Glee Club at the 2012 Choirs of the World festival in Wales this summer.

I have also had a relatively successful semester in terms of web development. After working on the total Leacock's redesign this summer, I didn't have a whole lot to do except for implement changes and the Photosets feature in the Photos section. I pursued other avenues through which I could expand my webdev experience, and was fortunate enough to have been chosen as this year's Information Technology Manager for Hotel Ezra Cornell 87. It has been a truly rewarding experience to work with the impassioned Board of Directors to create something for HEC which is new and innovative.

I was also lucky enough to have been chosen to work with Terran Exchange this semester, which was the first time I had ever dabbled in a Rails application that meant something to someone. I have worked on a few projects to learn Ruby and Rails, but never had I worked on a project that was, for lack of a better term, _legit_. It was a pleasure to work with the TE team and to contribute, ever so slightly, to the project.

Those who know me well, know that I struggled in High School with acceptance and personal issues that posed social challenges. Knowing that I have historically struggled with this, I have been delightfully surprised with the remarkable turn-around I have shown this semester. I feel I have connected astonishingly well with those around me on campus this semester. Last year, at McGill, I did not emphasize the importance of social interaction enough, and therefore had a less-than-optimal time at McGill. But I seem to be relishing in this new institution, with its delightfully brilliant population.

I have talked enough about the good; consequently, it is only fitting that I discuss the bad. I am quite disappointed in my grades this semester. I have talked it over with many here and they seem to disagree. They feel that I am doing average, or even better than average in my classes. That being said, I don't have the 3.75 that I achieved last year at McGill. I imagine that this discrepancy is merely the result of the increased difficulty of the school at which I am currently enrolled, but I definitely feel inferior to my classmates. I'm hoping it is all in my head.

I am disappointed in my display (or lack) of personal self- control this semester. I have certainly skipped many-a party to work on homework, but issues like timeliness still bug me to this day. For some very strange reason, getting to a meeting, a class, a rehearsal on time are still bugging me.

So I have told you enough about my life interesting/strange semester. Now let me offer you my solutions:

1. ALWAYS be on time.
2. Write down and UTILIZE office hours.
3. Focus on your schoolwork - it is the reason you are here. 
4. Strive to fully understand what you are learning - don't just commit to rote memory.
5. Find balance between challenging and not-so-challenging courses so as not to overload yourself.
6. Develop a routine and stick with it.
7. Be happy with who you are and always strive to work your very hardest. You are capable of succeeding at Cornell, you just need to be more comprehensive in your approach.
8. DO NOT SQUANDER AWAY TIME.
9. Limit the number of blogs you subscribe to. "Lifehacker" will not actually help you in school. Just glance at their  highlights when and if you have a free minute.
10. Sleep. If you organize and schedule your time appropriately, this will not be an issue.

There you have it. A couple personal goals for me to work toward next semester. Thanks for reading.
