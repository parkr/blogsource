I just read an [appalling story by _Upworthy_][1] that singles out 10 Democratic
senators who do not support full marriage equality for gays and lesbians. This
article is an absolute disgrace. Upworthy (and the _Huffington Post_ for that
matter) should not be singling out Democrats who do not believe in same-sex
marriage as though it's some unnatural digression from the widely-accepted
democratic platform. No, they should be listing **every** senator that does
not support same-sex marriage.

It is not a fundamental tenant of the democratic platform. It is a fundamental
tenant of reason, of American law, and of human equality. There is no good
reason every congressperson should not support same-sex marriage. This is not
about party lines. This is about human dignity and equality in the eyes of the
law.
