I noticed something recently: I have a more positive reaction to saying "I'm a
failure," than to saying "I've failed."

This is the opposite of conventional wisdom, which argues that admitting to
failure of an action is better for the psyche than admitting that the psyche
is itself flawed. I will attempt to offer an explanation, based on my own
observations and experiences of failing.

The root of this difference is in the ability of someone to rectify the outcome
of the failure. Namely, by admitting that I have failed, the outcome seems to be
final and irreversible. Conversely, by admitting that I am a failure, the outcome
will be easily rectified by an outsider who is not a failure. The fact than a
"failure" perfect the action or inaction means that he or she is sub-par and that
any "normal" person could reverse the negative outcome, for an outcome which is
"less negative" than that which formerly existed.

When someone has failed, it usually means that only someone superior to that person
can succeed. Note that superiority may not necessarily be total, but it will be
observed in the key skills and qualities which are crucial to the success of the
task. In a normal situation, there is no guarantee that anyone superior will exist.
If that is the case, the outcome is final.

However, when someone is a failure, it implies that there is another person who
is superior and can rectify the situation. Thus, the outcome, in the end, is
better (due to the fact that the previous outcome was fixed).

So what would you rather see happen: would you rather be a failure and know that
someone can solve the mistakes you made, or have failed and leave the situation
possibly irreversibly worse than the status quo?
