iOS 7 has sparked a fantastic amount of controversy in the design world. Is the
design a step forward, or a step back? I've heard everything from "iOS 7
contains so many rookie mistakes â€“ Ives shouldn't have released his first draft"
to "iOS 7 is a step forward and will inspire app designers to try out new,
daring designs." I'm going to do something a bit more drastic. **iOS 7 is Donald
Norman's Worst Nightmare.**

For those of you who don't know, [Donald Norman][] is a very well-respected
designer from the late 20th century and has a great book out called ["The Design
of Everyday Things"][]. In the very first chapter, Norman outlines a set of
concepts crucial to the evaluation and creation of designs: visibility,
affordance, mapping and feedback. To illustrate this nightmare, I will show how
iOS 7 egregiously violates these four crucial concepts.
