Higher education is messed up. The incentives for learning as well as the structure of that learning is all wrong.

So what's this perspective? Well, let's define elements of this proposition. By "wrong", i mean "not conducive to the best mastery of the material" and by "structure of that learning", I'm talking about the overlap of classes &mdash; the simultaneous learning associated with taking more than one class during any one period of time. By "incentives", I mean "grades".

### Grades

Grades suck. Just about every student who's been evaluated and given a letter to indicate achievement will agree: tears have been shed and jobs have been lost &mdash; careers ruined &mdash; because of a letter.

At grade-obsessed Cornell University, the grade is the entire reason anyone seems to do anything. High grades are rewarded and low grades are punished. But how much do grades mean? Do they _actually_ measure the success and mastery of the material, or do they just exist to weed out "smart" from "stupid"? I'd argue that grades say nothing about _true_ mastery. Rather, they say "I can take a test well," and "I can write you an essay you think is good." But they don't necessarily say, "I know this and understand every bit of it." Too often, students memorize but don't truly understand.

Teachers &mdash; at any level &mdash; should ask more questions which force students to synthesize their knowledge and undersanding and not bother trying to label the "success" with a letter. These letters try to boil a student's worth down to an arbitrary orthographic symbol. We, the students, should learn by reading and asking questions. The more time we have alone with the material &mdash; for intraspection to develop true understanding &mdash; the more certain it is that it is true mastery we are achieving. Until the master thinks we have mastered the material, we need to continue learning and trying to understand the material.

### Structure

Structure is also a problem. We really ought to focus on _one_ topic and worth with it until we have truly mastered the material. Before mastery, we must not be distracted by other things. We must imerse ourselves in the topic entirelty and not let anything get in the way of our mastery.

The simultaneous class system must go. Take a class, perhaps one every three or four weeks, and do not move on until it is finished and mastery has been achieved. Once one has reached the mastery equivalent to that which the professor believes is true and perfect, then a new topic can be studied. Until then, we mustn't move on &mdash; mastery is the highest value of education.

### A New System

This new system will guarantee that every student has the same level of mastery and develops a personal connection with the masters and the material. One topic at a time and commitment to mastery rather than arbitrary grades and skewed test results, this new system uses the intuition of the master in knowing when the student has achieved his or her potential.

Incentives are misaligned. It's no longer about learning &mdash; it's about being told you're learning, even if you're not. It's time we realign incentives and learn to learn and master the material.
