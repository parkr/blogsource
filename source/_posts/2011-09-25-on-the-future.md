excerpt: Parker discusses his future at Cornell University and what it all means.

Following my arrival at Cornell, I began considering my future much more seriously. What would I like to see myself doing in 5 years? How will I get myself there?

To answer the former question, I see myself working in my career in five years. I will complete my B.S. in Information Science in 2014 and will follow that up with a one-year M.P.S. in the same department. That brings me to May 2015, only four years and a half years from how. I expect to find myself applying for full-time positions the previous semester at various tech firms such as Google, Etsy (my hands-down favorite), Hulu and other young firms. I'm working to build up my [resumé](http://www.parkermoore.de/ "My website is currently just an online resumé") and fortify my skill set with new languages, algorithms and the like.

Writing this, however, and having been a philosophy/political science/linguistics major last year at McGill, I can't help by wonder if it's all worth it. Our society dictates a certain path for future success. Those who are successful have earned a degree from an accredited institution such as Cornell, have perhaps pursued a graduate degree and go off to find a job that pays well. If only we valued our own happiness as much as our salaries, the world might be a better place. I hear talk of hopes to be millionaires and billionaires from students on campus and something about that appalls me while simultaneously exciting me. Wouldn't it be great to have a net worth of over one million dollars? But we mustn't forget that some of the happiest people on Earth live on a couple dollars a day. I wish to discover what it is they have that we are so lacking. Quality relationships with our families (the divorce rate is sky-high and I hear stories left and right about parents abandoning their children), perhaps? Or possibly an overwhelming sense of self-worth that our magazines and tabloids deny from us? If we are to have a happier future, collectively, then surely we must figure this out.

Pondering my future is a constant source of worry; not because I don't think I will be able to find a job, but because I don't wish to be a slave to my job nor dislike it. Do you know what I mean?
