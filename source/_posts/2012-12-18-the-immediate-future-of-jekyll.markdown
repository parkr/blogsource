[Jekyll][] is a static blog generator created by [Tom Preston-Werner][], the
current CEO of [GitHub][] and one of GitHub's co-founders, and by [Nick Quaranto][],
who is now at 37signals. Jekyll is [pretty freakin' popular][cite-1] and it's
also the engine that drives [GitHub Pages][].

After an hour-long chat with Tom, I'm optimistic about the future of Jekyll. He's
really excited about where it's headed and has a vision in mind about what he'd
like it to become.
Here's what we ironed out during our conversation:

Led by Tom, a Jekyll development team, of which I'm the first recruit, will
be tackling the problems with Jekyll and continuously improving its functionality
and ease-of-use. The focus will remain on making a tool that allows one to easily
create and manage a static blog.

Suuuper basic (unofficial) design principles:

1. Keep it simple
2. Easy to extend
3. Solid safe mode (for GitHub Pages)

What we need to tackle:

1. Fix bugs (!!)
2. Decrease build time (!!)
3. Docs for site
4. TomDoc everything
5. Release new site
6. Finish same site generator
7. Include some faster LSI

a fix.

I'm really excited about the immediate future of Jekyll and what it will become
in the next 6 months or so and the dev team takes on the issues outlined above.
I hope you're as excited as we are to get this project back on its feet.
