I live in sunny Ithaca, NY, where I attend Cornell University. In Ithaca (and 
Tompkins County), we enjoy the luxury of public transit, [Tompkins County Area
Transit Service](http://tcatbus.com), or "TCAT" for short. Advertisements are
placed on the side of these buses, and I saw one the other day which advertised for
Palantir. It struck my interest (I definitely like to program, so "code," "ship,"
and other exciting dev buzzwords got my attention) and I looked them up. They
advertised that they used Java. _Java_. __JAVA!__ _"Good Lord,"_ I thought, _"How can
any respectable developer use Java in today's world? Much better options exist."_

So, I tweeted my thoughts:

Interestingly enough, a dev from Palantir saw it (most companies ignore tweets at them
especially negatively-toned ones, like mine) and responded:

Ah, [a link](http://www.quora.com/Does-any-start-up-company-need-Java-developers-at-all-If-so-which-ones)!

So I went through this article and read what Ari had to say. The main arguments for
using Java I picked up from the post were:

1. It's mature: robust, lots of libraries, few bugs, huge dev community.
2. It's the only modern OO language fit for massive production needs.
3.
