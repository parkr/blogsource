  <div class="content"><p>Yep, I code in <a href='http://php.net/'>PHP</a>. Before you start knocking the language around for its antiquated syntax or what have you, I would like to explain.</p>

<p>(This post was inspired by <a href='http://beust.com/weblog/2011/08/09/i-like-php/'>Cedric&#8217;s post about PHP</a>. I agree, but wanted to elaborate a little more.)</p>

<h3 id='the_sites_i_work_on_are_written_in_php'>The Sites I Work On Are Written in PHP</h3>

<p>Pretty simple. I have done a lot of work with WordPress, CodeIgniter and CakePHP. Their seamless integration with the MySQL backend makes them prime content management systems for clients. Every server I&#8217;ve ever worked with has had PHP 5 installed on it with a MySQL database. Deploying to these systems requires only the most basic tools (I could theoretically use <code>scp</code> to move all my files to the server).</p>

<h3 id='php_is_popular'>PHP is Popular</h3>

<p>More websites are written with a PHP backend than any other language. Ruby is on the rise with <a href='http://www.heroku.com'>Heroku</a>&#8217;s easy deployment structure for Rails applications, but it&#8217;s still an underdog at this point. Another benefit of being popular is that PHP is well-documented and therefore the learning curve is less steep than with Ruby.</p>

<h3 id='php_is_awesome'>PHP is Awesome</h3>

<p>That&#8217;s right: PHP is awesome. I have used PHP for server scripting since I began more advanced coding in 8th grade. It&#8217;s been 6 years and I have written more in PHP than in any other language, despite having written 2 decently sized web apps with ROR. I love PHP and you should too. At least don&#8217;t discount its abilities.</p></div>
