  <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;ve been at <a href='http://www.cornell.edu/'>Cornell</a> for a little over a week and I can honestly admit I&#8217;ve never been this busy. Thanks to my time at McGill, I have been able to manage my time well, but this is a new level of busy for me!</p>

<p>Coursework has been relatively do-able; I&#8217;ve had 3 assignments and 7 readings to do. All in all, not too bad for 3 days of classes. Judging from what I know at this moment, <a href='http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=12&amp;coid=90911'><strong>CS2110</strong></a> is probably going to be the most work. Much of the theory behind the algorithms and mathematical problems is new to me and I suspect that will be the most difficult aspect of this class. <a href='http://www.infosci.cornell.edu/ugrad/CalsMajor.htm'><strong>INFO1300</strong></a> (Intro to Web Design), if I can&#8217;t obtain an exemption from the course, will be a cinch. I really don&#8217;t expect any issues with that class at all. <a href='http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=12&amp;coid=93470'><strong>INFO 2040</strong></a> will be lots of work, but the concepts we&#8217;re learning don&#8217;t seem too difficult to grasp. It&#8217;s also a huge class, so there&#8217;s plenty of opportunity to ask questions to others. It has a good reputation, too. <a href='http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=12&amp;coid=91639'><strong>EDUC2710</strong></a> is already turning out to be one of my favourite classes. Going to be a <em>lot</em> of work, but it&#8217;ll be worth it. I was recently given permission to enroll in <a href='http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=12&amp;coid=90949&amp;print'><strong>CS4999</strong></a>, a class where I conduct research and write web apps for college credit. All in all, a good deal.</p>

<p>Cornell offers wonderful academics, but I would argue that the extracurricular opportunities rival those in the academic world. I have chosen to get involved in the music scene here, having been accepted into the <a href='http://www.gleeclub.com/'>Cornell Glee Club</a> just last night! A Cappella auditions are this week, and I&#8217;m still working on those. I&#8217;m also hoping to get involved with the <a href='http://www.cornellsun.com/'>Cornell Daily Sun</a> as a web developer. There are a couple other clubs I&#8217;m looking into, but those are sort of on hold while auditions ensue.</p>

<p>In addition to all of this, I am a free-lance web developer/designer. I&#8217;m really excited to continue my Cornell experience. It&#8217;s amazing here and I don&#8217;t want to waste even one minute. Let&#8217;s end in song:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Far above Cayuga&#8217;s waters,<br /> With its waves of blue,<br /> Stands our noble Alma Mater,<br /> Glorious to view.<br /> <br /> Lift the chorus, speed it onward,<br /> Loud her praises tell;<br /> Hail to thee, our Alma Mater!<br /> Hail, all hail, Cornell!<br /> <br /> Far above the busy humming<br /> Of the bustling town,<br /> Reared against the arch of heaven,<br /> Looks she proudly down.<br /> <br /> Lift the chorus, speed it onward,<br /> Loud her praises tell;<br /> Hail to thee, our Alma Mater!<br /> Hail, all hail, Cornell!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I look forward to sharing more with you about Cornell and my experiences here.</p></div>
