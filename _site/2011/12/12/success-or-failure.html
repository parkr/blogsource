  <div class="content"><p>I can&#8217;t decide whether this semester was a success or a failure. There are so many things about which I should be proud, and an almost equal number of things about which I should be ashamed or disappointed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll start with the good news first. Right as the semester began, I was accepted into the Cornell University Glee Club and The Class Notes. I am very proud to be a member of both groups and have found the members of each group to be kind, considerate, and, most of all, accepting. We have made some beautiful music this semester, and I am especially excited to compete with the Glee Club at the 2012 Choirs of the World festival in Wales this summer.</p>

<p>I have also had a relatively successful semester in terms of web development. After working on the total Leacock&#8217;s redesign this summer, I didn&#8217;t have a whole lot to do except for implement changes and the Photosets feature in the Photos section. I pursued other avenues through which I could expand my webdev experience, and was fortunate enough to have been chosen as this year&#8217;s Information Technology Manager for Hotel Ezra Cornell 87. It has been a truly rewarding experience to work with the impassioned Board of Directors to create something for HEC which is new and innovative.</p>

<p>I was also lucky enough to have been chosen to work with Terran Exchange this semester, which was the first time I had ever dabbled in a Rails application that meant something to someone. I have worked on a few projects to learn Ruby and Rails, but never had I worked on a project that was, for lack of a better term, <em>legit</em>. It was a pleasure to work with the TE team and to contribute, ever so slightly, to the project.</p>

<p>Those who know me well, know that I struggled in High School with acceptance and personal issues that posed social challenges. Knowing that I have historically struggled with this, I have been delightfully surprised with the remarkable turn-around I have shown this semester. I feel I have connected astonishingly well with those around me on campus this semester. Last year, at McGill, I did not emphasize the importance of social interaction enough, and therefore had a less-than-optimal time at McGill. But I seem to be relishing in this new institution, with its delightfully brilliant population.</p>

<p>I have talked enough about the good; consequently, it is only fitting that I discuss the bad. I am quite disappointed in my grades this semester. I have talked it over with many here and they seem to disagree. They feel that I am doing average, or even better than average in my classes. That being said, I don&#8217;t have the 3.75 that I achieved last year at McGill. I imagine that this discrepancy is merely the result of the increased difficulty of the school at which I am currently enrolled, but I definitely feel inferior to my classmates. I&#8217;m hoping it is all in my head.</p>

<p>I am disappointed in my display (or lack) of personal self- control this semester. I have certainly skipped many-a party to work on homework, but issues like timeliness still bug me to this day. For some very strange reason, getting to a meeting, a class, a rehearsal on time are still bugging me.</p>

<p>So I have told you enough about my life interesting/strange semester. Now let me offer you my solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li>ALWAYS be on time.</li>

<li>Write down and UTILIZE office hours.</li>

<li>Focus on your schoolwork - it is the reason you are here.</li>

<li>Strive to fully understand what you are learning - don&#8217;t just commit to rote memory.</li>

<li>Find balance between challenging and not-so-challenging courses so as not to overload yourself.</li>

<li>Develop a routine and stick with it.</li>

<li>Be happy with who you are and always strive to work your very hardest. You are capable of succeeding at Cornell, you just need to be more comprehensive in your approach.</li>

<li>DO NOT SQUANDER AWAY TIME.</li>

<li>Limit the number of blogs you subscribe to. &#8220;Lifehacker&#8221; will not actually help you in school. Just glance at their highlights when and if you have a free minute.</li>

<li>Sleep. If you organize and schedule your time appropriately, this will not be an issue.</li>
</ol>

<p>There you have it. A couple personal goals for me to work toward next semester. Thanks for reading.</p></div>
