  <div class="content"><p><em>Oh, what joy! What rapture! We are young and unafraid; let all of christendom rejoice with us, for we are young!</em></p>

<p>Sometimes I think that being young is wonderful and sometimes I wish I could fast-forward time for 3 years, at which time I will have graduated from college and hopefully have a job. I was just dreaming about interning with <a href='http://www.github.com'>GitHub</a> next summer if the DIA internships don&#8217;t come through. I&#8217;m young - I can ask for a student discount and feel more than entitled. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I enjoy this, but I wish to have more responsibility. I am working on 3 websites this summer for various organizations, but find myself wanting more. I have a job at the local supermarket, but it&#8217;s menial and I feel as though the skills I have accrued are going unused. I want to use my skills - and get paid doing so.</p>

<p>I wonder if there is something I can do this summer - another organization I can work for - that would pay me for developing a website or a piece of software. Well, I have time. I may as well enjoy these summers I have before trying to give them away for money.</p>

<p>As an aside, I may continue with these late-night writings. I rather like them.</p></div>
