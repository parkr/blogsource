  <div class="content"><p>I wrote a nice post about sleep, and lost it all because &#8220;Kod&#8221; unexpectedly quit and I didn&#8217;t save it. Darn it.</p>

<h3 id='second_try'>Second try.</h3>

<p>Sleep is a basic human need. All people understand that. In fact, some organizations exploit this need. For example, a torture - sorry, &#8220;enhanced interrrogation&#8221; - techinque is sleep-deprivation. This technique inflicts great pain on the subject, as well as insanity and possibly death if the subject endures the deprivation for long enough. Most people see this deprivation as a terrible thing; a thing to be called a violation of human rights. Why, then, do we willingly inflict this pain on ourselves?</p>

<p>Western society teaches sleep-deprivation from an early age. In high school, a kid receives bragging rights after pulling an all-nighter. He or she is seen as really cool to all of his or her friends for doing something &#8220;bad&#8221; (probably just staying up past his or her bedtime&#8230;). The problem only exacerbates, however, in college, due to the immense workload that many (most) students take on. As the years progress and the work becomes more difficult, the students lose more and more sleep. They may sleep the proper number of hours over the weekend, but only if no work is to be done until the (late) afternoon and the party wasn&#8217;t too rough the night before (alcohol deteriorates sleep quality).</p>

<p>The problem doesn&#8217;t end there! The business world also robs its community members of sleep: an 8 am deal after a 1 am dinner party (they party hard). Bosses load on the work to their employees, many of whom are also busy with new children or the remains of a social life post-college. 5 hours of sleep is not enough - we know that, right?</p>

<p>So why do we insist on limiting the amount of sleep that we do get? The question is this: how do we mold society to allow the proper amount of sleep while still delivering all of the goodies we get today? Can we stagger work to the appropriate time, so that if work starts early, so does sleep? Would it be possible just to shut down the community for 8 hours a day (preferably when it&#8217;s dark)?</p>

<p>This post is not meant as a solution. Just a 5-in-the-morning rambling. Cheers.</p></div>
