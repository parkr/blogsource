  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/life.html">Life Counter</a></h2>
  <div class="content"><p>I was just reading Dustin Curtis&#8217;s blog post about <a href='http://www.dustincurtis.com/the_gap.html'>&#8220;The Gap&#8221;</a> and scrolled to the bottom after reading the post. Despite being an incredibly brilliant post &#8211; one that mimics my own discomfort at not being able to achieve to my standards, though not in design &#8211; I was far more fascinated by his &#8220;Life Counter&#8221;. Particularly, it was striking to see that Dustin had given himself a projected time of death, measured in days, hours, minutes and seconds he has left. He has an accompanying &#8220;life progress bar&#8221;, that stated, at the time of writing this post, that Dustin&#8217;s life was &#8220;34% complete&#8221;.</p>

<p>I clicked the link to read article #5, his &#8220;About&#8221; page. <a href='http://www.dustincurtis.com/about.html'>There</a>, I found an even more striking view of what it could be.</p>

<p>It put my life into a new perspective for me. I decided to look up my expected time of death. It is 74 years old. As a little bit of a web developer myself (ha, this will be my future career), I put together a little life counter below. It has definitely put things into perspective for me.</p>

<p>I will die in <span id='lifecounter'>0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, and 0 seconds</span> at the age of 74.</p></div>
