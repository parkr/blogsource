With the release of Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, Safari gained a new feature: Reading List. I still remember WWDC 2011, in which this was announced, and reading [a tweet by Marco Arment]() that read:

> Shit.

Arment, in the event that you are not aware, is the founder and sole creator of [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com). So what prompted this profane exclamation and how does it relate to Safari Reading List? Well, Reading List accomplishes much of what 

Marco has since responded to his tweet, saying that [he is optimistic about the launch of Reading List](). He believes that Reading List will, in fact, increase his overall revenue by introducing consumers to this type of service and, when Reading List is not enough to fulfill their needs, eventually converting them into Instapaper customers. I would tend to agree with Arment in his assessment, as Instapaper has many strategic advantages over Reading List.

However, I have identified one shortfall in Arment's evaluation. Specifically, invoking the Instapaper Text converter for a page (without saving) requires one to reload the page. In contrast, the Safari Reader does not require this. Rather, Reading List converts the current page into a readable format without requesting this page again, thus an advantage to those of us who have limited access to the internet (no iPhone, WiFi-dependent).

Instapaper has a lot of advantages, but loses out on this crucial advantage (though, without a browser plugin, this is impossible to achieve). It will be interesting to see how Reading List is taken and how Instapaper changes due to the presence of Reading List.
