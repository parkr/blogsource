Notes:

- 3 types:
	- long-ass security signatures with whole disclaimers in 'em
	- super short email signatures with as few as one letter
	- medium email signatures with a ("goodbye" of sorts), title, department, company, contact info
	- short signature with just a "Sincerely" and a name
- Advantages to each? Is the medium necessary, or is the short one the best?
- Email etiquette : is it bad to include even a medium email signature in all emails? seems excessive...
