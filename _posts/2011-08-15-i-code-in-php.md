title: I Code In PHP
excerpt: PHP is awesome, don't deny it.
---

Yep, I code in [PHP](http://php.net/). Before you start knocking the language around for its antiquated syntax or what have you, I would like to explain.

(This post was inspired by [Cedric's post about PHP](http://beust.com/weblog/2011/08/09/i-like-php/). I agree, but wanted to elaborate a little more.)

### The Sites I Work On Are Written in PHP

Pretty simple. I have done a lot of work with WordPress, CodeIgniter and CakePHP. Their seamless integration with the MySQL backend makes them prime content management systems for clients. Every server I've ever worked with has had PHP 5 installed on it with a MySQL database. Deploying to these systems requires only the most basic tools (I could theoretically use `scp` to move all my files to the server).

### PHP is Popular

More websites are written with a PHP backend than any other language. Ruby is on the rise with [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com)'s easy deployment structure for Rails applications, but it's still an underdog at this point. Another benefit of being popular is that PHP is well-documented and therefore the learning curve is less steep than with Ruby.

### PHP is Awesome

That's right: PHP is awesome. I have used PHP for server scripting since I began more advanced coding in 8th grade. It's been 6 years and I have written more in PHP than in any other language, despite having written 2 decently sized web apps with ROR. I love PHP and you should too. At least don't discount its abilities.
