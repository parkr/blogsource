title: Distractions and Mac OS X Lion

excerpt: Full-screen thoughts on Lion.

I was just reading [Caleb Ogden](http://xheight.co.uk/author/caleb-ogden/)'s [xheight post about distractions](http://xheight.co.uk/2011/06/27/going-dark/) and it got me thinking.

One of the key features of [Mac OS X Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) is the ability to use apps in full-screen. Before I purchased my Macbook Pro for university, I owned a Dell laptop running Windows Vista Home Premium (it was as awful as the rumors suggested) and almost every one of my apps run full-screen (maximized). Despite my ADD, I found that this full-screen goodness helped me focus on what was in front of me. It seemed odd to me that the greatest OS to ever exist, that was how it was purported, had some of the worst window management I had experienced (no, the green '+' stop-light is not a substitute for the Windows 'maximize' button). Now, in the seventh iteration of OS X, full-screen applications are becoming realized. I'm honestly baffled, but I welcome the change.

So anyway, I was thinking about how distracting it is to have multiple windows open per space (if you use those). With such a creative user base (I have always associated Mac with the [Adobe Creative Suite](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/design.html) and those who use it), I would have expected Mac to give this full-screen experience to their users without having to manually resize every window. Anyone else a little confused? OS X Lion gives OS X users some abilities they should have had many iterations ago and some they don't need (_Launchpad_).

Clearly my frustration with the OS X Lion is coming out. _Distractions._ Full-screen support is welcome. I'll be very glad to destroy distractions without having to pay $3 here and there for various window management software. Apple, thanks I guess.

(On a side note, Apple may need to do a little reconfiguring of their internal hierarchy. Slow change is what they're getting quite good at.)
