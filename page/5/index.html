  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was reading <em>Teens in Tech</em>&#39;s <a href="http://teensintech.com/blog/2011/10/social-business-math-class/">blog post</a> about how student entrepreneurs ought to manage their business while they are at school and in class. I have to disagree a bit with what <a href="http://twitter.com/benpaster">Ben Paster</a> advised we do.</p>

<p>Ben implicitly encouraged the use of every moment of downtime to answer support tweets and emails and to purchase a smart phone to help do this on-the-go. Though this seems like a great idea on the surface, I would strongly advise <em>against</em> this. For one, you begin to allow these minor issues to follow you around. I opt to keep all of my business emails in a place that is, yes, readily accessible, but also out of sight. While at school, and especially in high school, the distraction of a smartphone certainly means that the student will not be fully absorbing all of the information he or she is being taught. Few students, even those of the entrepreneurial type, have the self-control to keep the phone out of sight, even during class. An entrepreneur may be brilliant and resourceful in his or her area of business, but may not grasp the meaning being extracted from <em>A Raisin&#39; In The Sun</em> or <em>Hamlet</em> during English class if he or she is also trying to answer support queries at the same time. I know from personal experience that a distracted student is usually not a very good one.</p>

<p>I would also argue that the phone would be a distraction not only in class but also out of it. I see it all the time: two friends walking next to each other, one speaking, the other trying to listen and text at the same time. That will certainly put a damper on your relationships with friends. Same goes for the relationships with your family members. Trust me: the smartphone can be used for good, but will often just get in your way.</p>

<p>So my advice to the student entrepreneur: find a way to be able to tuck the constant barrage of information away while enjoying life and learning. They don&#39;t need to be instantly answered - take the night off, go see a movie and enjoy being with your friends or family. You deserve it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Following my arrival at Cornell, I began considering my future much more seriously. What would I like to see myself doing in 5 years? How will I get myself there?</p>

<p>To answer the former question, I see myself working in my career in five years. I will complete my B.S. in Information Science in 2014 and will follow that up with a one-year M.P.S. in the same department. That brings me to May 2015, only four years and a half years from how. I expect to find myself applying for full-time positions the previous semester at various tech firms such as Google, Etsy (my hands-down favorite), Hulu and other young firms. I&#39;m working to build up my <a href="http://www.parkermoore.de/" title="My website is currently just an online resumé">resumé</a> and fortify my skill set with new languages, algorithms and the like.</p>

<p>Writing this, however, and having been a philosophy/political science/linguistics major last year at McGill, I can&#39;t help by wonder if it&#39;s all worth it. Our society dictates a certain path for future success. Those who are successful have earned a degree from an accredited institution such as Cornell, have perhaps pursued a graduate degree and go off to find a job that pays well. If only we valued our own happiness as much as our salaries, the world might be a better place. I hear talk of hopes to be millionaires and billionaires from students on campus and something about that appalls me while simultaneously exciting me. Wouldn&#39;t it be great to have a net worth of over one million dollars? But we mustn&#39;t forget that some of the happiest people on Earth live on a couple dollars a day. I wish to discover what it is they have that we are so lacking. Quality relationships with our families (the divorce rate is sky-high and I hear stories left and right about parents abandoning their children), perhaps? Or possibly an overwhelming sense of self-worth that our magazines and tabloids deny from us? If we are to have a happier future, collectively, then surely we must figure this out.</p>

<p>Pondering my future is a constant source of worry; not because I don&#39;t think I will be able to find a job, but because I don&#39;t wish to be a slave to my job nor dislike it. Do you know what I mean?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#39;ve been at <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell</a> for a little over a week and I can honestly admit I&#39;ve never been this busy. Thanks to my time at McGill, I have been able to manage my time well, but this is a new level of busy for me!</p>

<p>Coursework has been relatively do-able; I&#39;ve had 3 assignments and 7 readings to do. All in all, not too bad for 3 days of classes. Judging from what I know at this moment, <a href="http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=12&amp;coid=90911"><strong>CS2110</strong></a> is probably going to be the most work. Much of the theory behind the algorithms and mathematical problems is new to me and I suspect that will be the most difficult aspect of this class. <a href="http://www.infosci.cornell.edu/ugrad/CalsMajor.htm"><strong>INFO1300</strong></a> (Intro to Web Design), if I can&#39;t obtain an exemption from the course, will be a cinch. I really don&#39;t expect any issues with that class at all. <a href="http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=12&amp;coid=93470"><strong>INFO 2040</strong></a> will be lots of work, but the concepts we&#39;re learning don&#39;t seem too difficult to grasp. It&#39;s also a huge class, so there&#39;s plenty of opportunity to ask questions to others. It has a good reputation, too. <a href="http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=12&amp;coid=91639"><strong>EDUC2710</strong></a> is already turning out to be one of my favourite classes. Going to be a <em>lot</em> of work, but it&#39;ll be worth it. I was recently given permission to enroll in <a href="http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=12&amp;coid=90949&amp;print"><strong>CS4999</strong></a>, a class where I conduct research and write web apps for college credit. All in all, a good deal.</p>

<p>Cornell offers wonderful academics, but I would argue that the extracurricular opportunities rival those in the academic world. I have chosen to get involved in the music scene here, having been accepted into the <a href="http://www.gleeclub.com/">Cornell Glee Club</a> just last night! A Cappella auditions are this week, and I&#39;m still working on those. I&#39;m also hoping to get involved with the <a href="http://www.cornellsun.com/">Cornell Daily Sun</a> as a web developer. There are a couple other clubs I&#39;m looking into, but those are sort of on hold while auditions ensue.</p>

<p>In addition to all of this, I am a free-lance web developer/designer. I&#39;m really excited to continue my Cornell experience. It&#39;s amazing here and I don&#39;t want to waste even one minute. Let&#39;s end in song:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Far above Cayuga&#39;s waters,<br />
  With its waves of blue,<br />
  Stands our noble Alma Mater,<br />
  Glorious to view.<br />
  <br />
  Lift the chorus, speed it onward,<br />
  Loud her praises tell;<br />
  Hail to thee, our Alma Mater!<br />
  Hail, all hail, Cornell!<br />
  <br />
  Far above the busy humming<br />
  Of the bustling town,<br />
  Reared against the arch of heaven,<br />
  Looks she proudly down.<br />
  <br />
  Lift the chorus, speed it onward,<br />
  Loud her praises tell;<br />
  Hail to thee, our Alma Mater!<br />
  Hail, all hail, Cornell!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I look forward to sharing more with you about Cornell and my experiences here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep, I code in <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a>. Before you start knocking the language around for its antiquated syntax or what have you, I would like to explain.</p>

<p>(This post was inspired by <a href="http://beust.com/weblog/2011/08/09/i-like-php/">Cedric&#39;s post about PHP</a>. I agree, but wanted to elaborate a little more.)</p>

<h3>The Sites I Work On Are Written in PHP</h3>

<p>Pretty simple. I have done a lot of work with WordPress, CodeIgniter and CakePHP. Their seamless integration with the MySQL backend makes them prime content management systems for clients. Every server I&#39;ve ever worked with has had PHP 5 installed on it with a MySQL database. Deploying to these systems requires only the most basic tools (I could theoretically use <code>scp</code> to move all my files to the server).</p>

<h3>PHP is Popular</h3>

<p>More websites are written with a PHP backend than any other language. Ruby is on the rise with <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>&#39;s easy deployment structure for Rails applications, but it&#39;s still an underdog at this point. Another benefit of being popular is that PHP is well-documented and therefore the learning curve is less steep than with Ruby.</p>

<h3>PHP is Awesome</h3>

<p>That&#39;s right: PHP is awesome. I have used PHP for server scripting since I began more advanced coding in 8th grade. It&#39;s been 6 years and I have written more in PHP than in any other language, despite having written 2 decently sized web apps with ROR. I love PHP and you should too. At least don&#39;t discount its abilities.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was just reading through <a href="http://www.google.com/accounts/TOS?hl=en&amp;loc=US">Google+&#39;s Terms of Service</a> because I was interested to see what was to happen to my images, should I upload them to Google+. I am weary to upload photos to <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, because Facebook claims rights to my images and may do with them whatever it pleases. This bothers me, and I wanted to see if Google+ was going to be the same.</p>

<p>If you read Section 9, it states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>9.4   Other than the limited license set forth in Section 11, Google acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content that you submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds peachy, doesn&#39;t it? I would propose that Google&#39;s betting you&#39;re lazy and, if you read the TOS at <em>all</em>, you sure as hell won&#39;t follow the references. Well, I did. Here&#39;s Section 11:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>11.2   You agree that this license includes a right for Google to make such Content available to other companies, organizations or individuals with whom Google has relationships for the provision of syndicated services, and to use such Content in connection with the provision of those services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hm. Not so good. I would really prefer that the stated &quot;other companies, organizations or individuals&quot; <strong>not</strong> have access to my content. But there&#39;s that phrase where, if you&#39;re not in the business, you wouldn&#39;t understand: <em>syndicated services</em>. Hm. What <em>is</em> that?</p>

<p>Well, I have an answer for you. From <a href="http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/definition/syndication">TechTarget&#39;s definition</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For many years mainly a feature of print media, today content syndication is the way a great deal of information is disseminated across the Web. Reuters, for example, provides online news content to over 900 Web sites and portals, such as Yahoo and America Online.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Google or any of its affiliates who fall into the above category are allowed to disseminate my information across the Web.</p>

<p>No thank you. I think I&#39;ll post them somewhere else, thanks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Oh, what joy! What rapture! We are young and unafraid; let all of christendom rejoice with us, for we are young!</em></p>

<p>Sometimes I think that being young is wonderful and sometimes I wish I could fast-forward time for 3 years, at which time I will have graduated from college and hopefully have a job. I was just dreaming about interning with <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> next summer if the DIA internships don&#39;t come through. I&#39;m young - I can ask for a student discount and feel more than entitled. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I enjoy this, but I wish to have more responsibility. I am working on 3 websites this summer for various organizations, but find myself wanting more. I have a job at the local supermarket, but it&#39;s menial and I feel as though the skills I have accrued are going unused. I want to use my skills - and get paid doing so.</p>

<p>I wonder if there is something I can do this summer - another organization I can work for - that would pay me for developing a website or a piece of software. Well, I have time. I may as well enjoy these summers I have before trying to give them away for money.</p>

<p>As an aside, I may continue with these late-night writings. I rather like them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote a nice post about sleep, and lost it all because &quot;Kod&quot; unexpectedly quit and I didn&#39;t save it.
Darn it.</p>

<h3>Second try.</h3>

<p>Sleep is a basic human need. All people understand that. In fact, some organizations exploit this need. For example, a torture - sorry, &quot;enhanced interrrogation&quot; - techinque is sleep-deprivation. This technique inflicts great pain on the subject, as well as insanity and possibly death if the subject endures the deprivation for long enough. Most people see this deprivation as a terrible thing; a thing to be called a violation of human rights. Why, then, do we willingly inflict this pain on ourselves?</p>

<p>Western society teaches sleep-deprivation from an early age. In high school, a kid receives bragging rights after pulling an all-nighter. He or she is seen as really cool to all of his or her friends for doing something &quot;bad&quot; (probably just staying up past his or her bedtime&#8230;). The problem only exacerbates, however, in college, due to the immense workload that many (most) students take on. As the years progress and the work becomes more difficult, the students lose more and more sleep. They may sleep the proper number of hours over the weekend, but only if no work is to be done until the (late) afternoon and the party wasn&#39;t too rough the night before (alcohol deteriorates sleep quality).</p>

<p>The problem doesn&#39;t end there! The business world also robs its community members of sleep: an 8 am deal after a 1 am dinner party (they party hard). Bosses load on the work to their employees, many of whom are also busy with new children or the remains of a social life post-college. 5 hours of sleep is not enough - we know that, right?</p>

<p>So why do we insist on limiting the amount of sleep that we do get? The question is this: how do we mold society to allow the proper amount of sleep while still delivering all of the goodies we get today? Can we stagger work to the appropriate time, so that if work starts early, so does sleep? Would it be possible just to shut down the community for 8 hours a day (preferably when it&#39;s dark)?</p>

<p>This post is not meant as a solution. Just a 5-in-the-morning rambling. Cheers.</p>
