  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was recently cleaning out my room at home (I&#8217;m back from college for the summer) and found an old <code>git</code> cheat-sheet. I thought I would electronically log it for future reference (as though I don&#8217;t use git every day or something&#8230;).</p>

<pre><code>git init
git clone git://github.com/username/repo.git
git add filename
git status [-s]
git diff [--cached] [HEAD] [--stat]
git commit [-a] [-m "commit message"]
git reset [HEAD]
git rm [--cached] filename 
    # (by adding --cached, the file that's deleted 
    # will be left in your local directory)

git branch branchname
git checkout branchname
git checkout -b branchname
git branch -d branchname # (delete)

git merge branchname # (merges 'branchname' to current branch)
git mv file newfile
git log [--oneline] [--graph] [branchname] [^compared_branch_name]
git tag -a msg commit_shortcode

git remote [-v]
git remote add alias git@github.com:username/repo.git
git fetch alias

<p>Well, there it is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Oh, what joy! What rapture! We are young and unafraid; let all of christendom rejoice with us, for we are young!</em></p>

<p>Sometimes I think that being young is wonderful and sometimes I wish I could fast-forward time for 3 years, at which time I will have graduated from college and hopefully have a job. I was just dreaming about interning with <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> next summer if the DIA internships don&#8217;t come through. I&#8217;m young - I can ask for a student discount and feel more than entitled. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I enjoy this, but I wish to have more responsibility. I am working on 3 websites this summer for various organizations, but find myself wanting more. I have a job at the local supermarket, but it&#8217;s menial and I feel as though the skills I have accrued are going unused. I want to use my skills - and get paid doing so.</p>

<p>I wonder if there is something I can do this summer - another organization I can work for - that would pay me for developing a website or a piece of software. Well, I have time. I may as well enjoy these summers I have before trying to give them away for money.</p>

<p>As an aside, I may continue with these late-night writings. I rather like them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote a nice post about sleep, and lost it all because &#8220;Kod&#8221; unexpectedly quit and I didn&#8217;t save it.
Darn it.</p>

<h3>Second try.</h3>

<p>Sleep is a basic human need. All people understand that. In fact, some organizations exploit this need. For example, a torture - sorry, &#8220;enhanced interrrogation&#8221; - techinque is sleep-deprivation. This technique inflicts great pain on the subject, as well as insanity and possibly death if the subject endures the deprivation for long enough. Most people see this deprivation as a terrible thing; a thing to be called a violation of human rights. Why, then, do we willingly inflict this pain on ourselves?</p>

<p>Western society teaches sleep-deprivation from an early age. In high school, a kid receives bragging rights after pulling an all-nighter. He or she is seen as really cool to all of his or her friends for doing something &#8220;bad&#8221; (probably just staying up past his or her bedtime&#8230;). The problem only exacerbates, however, in college, due to the immense workload that many (most) students take on. As the years progress and the work becomes more difficult, the students lose more and more sleep. They may sleep the proper number of hours over the weekend, but only if no work is to be done until the (late) afternoon and the party wasn&#8217;t too rough the night before (alcohol deteriorates sleep quality).</p>

<p>The problem doesn&#8217;t end there! The business world also robs its community members of sleep: an 8 am deal after a 1 am dinner party (they party hard). Bosses load on the work to their employees, many of whom are also busy with new children or the remains of a social life post-college. 5 hours of sleep is not enough - we know that, right?</p>

<p>So why do we insist on limiting the amount of sleep that we do get? The question is this: how do we mold society to allow the proper amount of sleep while still delivering all of the goodies we get today? Can we stagger work to the appropriate time, so that if work starts early, so does sleep? Would it be possible just to shut down the community for 8 hours a day (preferably when it&#8217;s dark)?</p>

<p>This post is not meant as a solution. Just a 5-in-the-morning rambling. Cheers.</p>
