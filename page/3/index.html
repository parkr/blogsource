  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> is a static blog generator created by <a href="https://github.com/mojombo">Tom Preston-Werner</a>, the
current CEO of <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and one of GitHub&#8217;s co-founders, and by <a href="https://github.com/qrush">Nick Quaranto</a>,
who is now at 37signals. Jekyll is <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites">pretty freakin&#8217; popular</a> and it&#8217;s
also the engine that drives <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<p>After an hour-long chat with Tom, I&#8217;m optimistic about the future of Jekyll. He&#8217;s
really excited about where it&#8217;s headed and has a vision in mind about what he&#8217;d
like it to become.
Here&#8217;s what we ironed out during our conversation:</p>

<p>Led by Tom, a Jekyll development team, of which I&#8217;m the first recruit, will
be tackling the problems with Jekyll and continuously improving its functionality
and ease-of-use. The focus will remain on making a tool that allows one to easily
create and manage a static blog.</p>

<p>Suuuper basic (unofficial) design principles:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep it simple</li>
<li>Easy to extend</li>
<li>Solid safe mode (for GitHub Pages)</li>
</ol>


<p>What we need to tackle:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fix bugs (!!)</li>
<li>Decrease build time (!!)</li>
<li>Docs for site</li>
<li>TomDoc everything</li>
<li>Release new site</li>
<li>Finish same site generator</li>
<li>Include some faster LSI</li>
</ol>

Want to contribute code? Check out the <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues">issues</a> and submit a pull request with
a fix.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really excited about the immediate future of Jekyll and what it will become
in the next 6 months or so and the dev team takes on the issues outlined above.
I hope you&#8217;re as excited as we are to get this project back on its feet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Email notifications from web apps have been annoying us for months now. Ever since Twitter, Facebook and other notification-heavy apps began automatically sending notifications to us (alas, without our consent), public opinion seems to have developed a hatred for email notifications. But, I implore you, understand the flipside:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/278705209507721217"><img src="/images/tweet-by-marco-arment.png" alt="Tweet by Marco Arment" /></a></p>

<p>Email notifications in web apps is a way of unifying one&#8217;s virtual &#8220;inbox&#8221;. Dealing with too many is overwhelming.</p>

<p>Keep email notifications around.</p>

<p>(But, for pete&#8217;s sake, <em>ask</em> your users whether they want email notifications before you activate them for their accounts.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a huge advocate of static site generators and have always favoured <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> as my go-to static site generator.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s fallen out of active development. I&#8217;ve been trying to contact Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo">@mojombo</a>) about it, but so far: nothing. (To be fair, I have gotten two replies, but they were not productive other than saying that he was looking for new maintainers. That was May 2012.)</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s my open letter to you, Tom, about saving   Jekyll from open-source oblivion.</p>

<blockquote><p>Tom,</p>

<p>Hope you had a pleasant weekend.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I wish to see happen with Jekyll:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start an Org on Github and move the Jekyll repo to that org</li>
<li>Add several maintainers to that org (I&#8217;d be happy to help out as a maintainer!)</li>
<li>Add another author or two to the Jekyll gem so that we can gem push and release new versions.</li>
<li>Give at least one other person access to push to the source of jekyllrb.com so that the docs can be updated</li>
</ol>


<p>Problem I&#8217;m trying to solve:</p>

<blockquote><p>Jekyll is incredibly popular and is an incredibly powerful tool, but is not being actively maintained centrally, so though the world around it is evolving, it is staying stagnant and plagued by the same issues it has been for the last four years.</p></blockquote>

<p>Solution:</p>

<blockquote><p>Add maintainers to Jekyll to help deal with issues, push new versions, and update the documentation when you don&#8217;t have the time.</p></blockquote>

<p>The great thing about version control systems is that changes can always be reverted.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your attention to this problem and willingness to help it continue growing.</p>

<p>Warm Regards,<br>
Parker Moore</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have really adored iA Writer and use the app obsessively on my iPhone, iPad and Mac. It&#8217;s arguably one of my most oft-used apps. I write all sorts of things with the app: blog posts/ideas (like this one), essays, lab reports &#8211; even the occasional code snippet. It&#8217;s my writing tool of choice, and I thank Information Architects for writing such an awesome app.</p>

<p>I also print out a lot of my writing. I like to edit by hand with a pen and paper. I like the beautiful typeface that iA Writer provides and the margins on 8.5&#8221; x 11&#8221; paper (US) are amazing. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed the almost typewriter-like essence of the print-outs which iA Writer provides.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d really love some more configuration options for printing, however. While I will undoubtedly hear the argument that iA Writer offers no configuration <em>on purpose</em>, I will argue that the &#8220;No Configuration Rule&#8221; must only apply to in-app writing, not to the manifestation of this writing in paper form.</p>

<p>The No Configuration Rule is supported by the fact that configuration and modification of the working environment is often a hindrance to one&#8217;s ability to write awesome content. It&#8217;s a distraction. But it&#8217;s a distraction only when <em>writing</em>, not when printing. I&#8217;d say this No Configuration Rule thus can only be justified for writing, i.e. on;y be justified for the look and feel of the writing experience in the app.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s an argument with too many implications. Let&#8217;s make it a bit smaller, to the size of a wish:</p>

<p>My only real wish for this app is to allow double-spaced print-outs. That&#8217;s it. I want to be able to edit my papers double-spaced.</p>

<p>So what say you, Information Architects? Think it&#8217;s possible? I&#8217;d really appreciate it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve decided to take next semester off (Spring 2013) to pursue an internship at <a href="http://6wunderkinder.com">6Wunderkinder</a> in Berlin, Germany. I&#8217;ll be starting work at the end of January and returning to the U.S. around the middle of August. I&#8217;m very excited that 6Wunderkinder extended their offer for an internship to me and were down with a 6-7 month internship. I&#8217;m pumped to be working with such awesome web and app devs.</p>

<p>So how did this happen? It&#8217;s a long story that I&#8217;ll talk about later, but for now I&#8217;ll give you the abridged version.</p>

<p>In the bleak winter of 2011, I emailed 6W about the possibility of a 3-month summer internship (May, June, July) in 2013. They replied very kindly, basically saying that it was way too early to say whether that was a possibility.</p>

<p>This Fall, I sent them a follow-up email asking if they were still interested. They replied saying that it was a definite possibility and asked that I send along some projects I had worked on. After reviewing my email &#8220;project resume&#8221;, they offered me an interview. Thanksgiving morning, I woke up bright and early to meet Ben on Skype. Great fun, and got to meet Isaac and Alex of the 6W API team, too. Ben followed up with an email offering a second interview.</p>

<p>During the time between the first and second interviews, I decided that I needed a break from my studies - Cornell is a particularly rigorous place and has a tendency to be demoralizing. So it was time for a break so that I could return in the Fall with new energy and vigor. I shot Ben an email indicating my interest in starting to work for them as early as the end of January, and to my surprise, were very interested in having me earlier.</p>

<p>During the second interview, I talked with Isaac and Ben more about what my role at 6Wunderkinder would be and how life in Berlin would look for me. All seemed really cool. When Ben officially made the offer to have me as an intern, I gladly accepted and we discussed logistics.</p>

<p>So there it is! It&#8217;s amazing what an email can do nowadays when you have congruent interests and a cool, responsive company like 6W.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to really miss <a href="http://theclassnotes.com">The Class Notes</a>, the <a href="http://gleeclub.com">Glee Club</a> (no, not like the show &#8220;Glee&#8221;), and my other friends here, and the ease of college life. That being said, I&#8217;m really grateful for this amazing opportunity abroad with a one-of-a-kind start-up like 6W.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Ben Braun, Isaac Wolkerstorfer, Alex Koppel, and the whole 6Wunderkinder team for giving me the opportunity. Thanks, guys!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may have heard about the recent eruption of violence in Israel and the
Gaza Strip. You may have your opinions set, but just hear me out.</p>

<p>So the way the story goes is that Gaza has been firing lots of rockets
into Israel and Israel has decided to retaliate by firing its own rockets
and otherwise bombarding the Gaza Strip with explosives. So, fire and fire
are at work here.</p>

<p>This is wrong. Hamas (the current leaders of Gaza) is wrong and Israel is
wrong. There is nothing morally justifiable about what either party is doing.</p>

<p>Many have expressed sympathy with Israel and an acquaintance of mine even
posted <a href="">a video produced by the Israel Defense Forces about why it has the
right to retaliate</a> on Facebook. There is absolutely no &#8220;right&#8221; to kill
anyone. No one can justifiably kill anyone else.</p>

<p>Enter: moral excusability. While killing another human being is <em>never</em> morally
justifiable, it is often viewed as morally excusable. That is, it is not
<em>right</em> to kill another human being, but it isn&#8217;t wrong (given the circumstances)
either. Well, that&#8217;s bullshit. If something isn&#8217;t morally justifiable, don&#8217;t do
it.</p>

<p>This eye-for-an-eye thing is getting out of hand. Both parties need to stop
hurting each other and begin discussing what can be done to peacefull coexist.
Unless Israel kills all the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, there will never
be peace. Unfortunately, it seems like their hawkish Prime Minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, is just about ready to kill off every non-Israeli in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>This whole situation is just despicable.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2012-11-01T10:17:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 1<span>st</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Higher education is messed up. The incentives for learning as well as the structure of that learning is all wrong.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s this perspective? Well, let&#8217;s define elements of this proposition. By &#8220;wrong&#8221;, i mean &#8220;not conducive to the best mastery of the material&#8221; and by &#8220;structure of that learning&#8221;, I&#8217;m talking about the overlap of classes &mdash; the simultaneous learning associated with taking more than one class during any one period of time. By &#8220;incentives&#8221;, I mean &#8220;grades&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Grades</h3>

<p>Grades suck. Just about every student who&#8217;s been evaluated and given a letter to indicate achievement will agree: tears have been shed and jobs have been lost &mdash; careers ruined &mdash; because of a letter.</p>

<p>At grade-obsessed Cornell University, the grade is the entire reason anyone seems to do anything. High grades are rewarded and low grades are punished. But how much do grades mean? Do they <em>actually</em> measure the success and mastery of the material, or do they just exist to weed out &#8220;smart&#8221; from &#8220;stupid&#8221;? I&#8217;d argue that grades say nothing about <em>true</em> mastery. Rather, they say &#8220;I can take a test well,&#8221; and &#8220;I can write you an essay you think is good.&#8221; But they don&#8217;t necessarily say, &#8220;I know this and understand every bit of it.&#8221; Too often, students memorize but don&#8217;t truly understand.</p>

<p>Teachers &mdash; at any level &mdash; should ask more questions which force students to synthesize their knowledge and undersanding and not bother trying to label the &#8220;success&#8221; with a letter. These letters try to boil a student&#8217;s worth down to an arbitrary orthographic symbol. We, the students, should learn by reading and asking questions. The more time we have alone with the material &mdash; for intraspection to develop true understanding &mdash; the more certain it is that it is true mastery we are achieving. Until the master thinks we have mastered the material, we need to continue learning and trying to understand the material.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>Structure is also a problem. We really ought to focus on <em>one</em> topic and worth with it until we have truly mastered the material. Before mastery, we must not be distracted by other things. We must imerse ourselves in the topic entirelty and not let anything get in the way of our mastery.</p>

<p>The simultaneous class system must go. Take a class, perhaps one every three or four weeks, and do not move on until it is finished and mastery has been achieved. Once one has reached the mastery equivalent to that which the professor believes is true and perfect, then a new topic can be studied. Until then, we mustn&#8217;t move on &mdash; mastery is the highest value of education.</p>

<h3>A New System</h3>

<p>This new system will guarantee that every student has the same level of mastery and develops a personal connection with the masters and the material. One topic at a time and commitment to mastery rather than arbitrary grades and skewed test results, this new system uses the intuition of the master in knowing when the student has achieved his or her potential.</p>

<p>Incentives are misaligned. It&#8217;s no longer about learning &mdash; it&#8217;s about being told you&#8217;re learning, even if you&#8217;re not. It&#8217;s time we realign incentives and learn to learn and master the material.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished up reading <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2012/08/05/managing-email-realistically/">Matt Gemmell&#8217;s post on email management</a>. If you haven&#8217;t read it, you&#8217;ll want to do make sure you head over to his site and give it a quick read before continuing.</p>

<p>Firstly, I should say that I am a manager, a developer, a web developer and a university student. I get a shit-ton of emails, so don&#8217;t think I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have developed an email attack-plan that works well for me, and I think works well for most people I know. This plan entails a seek-and-destroy method of achieving and maintaining Inbox Zero.</p>

<ol>
<li>Have a smartphone. Not only are these things super hip, but they&#8217;re handy as hell for killing off swarms of emails you get throughout the day.</li>
<li>Use your time wisely. Don&#8217;t twiddle your thumbs while on the bus/train/subway on the way to work. Rather, delete the worthless emails and read through the important ones. Re-mark them as unread until you get to the office.</li>
<li>Leverage the full keyboard. After the longest commute you&#8217;ve ever had to make, you&#8217;ve deleted or archived the bogus emails, so now you just have an inbox of awesome emails to go. Spend a half hour to an hour to get back to Inbox Zero. As Matt suggests, read the ones from your friends first &mdash; they&#8217;re always hilarious/useful/intriguing/important.</li>
<li>Go through your work emails after you&#8217;ve had a good laugh. You&#8217;ll be in a better mood when you tell the designer you&#8217;re working with that they&#8217;re crazy and you won&#8217;t come off as such a jerk. Win. Be detailed with these, but be very precise and concise - no one likes a long email.</li>
<li>Next, family. They&#8217;re usually cute and/or stupid. Send a quick reply (&#8220;Cute! Love, Parker&#8221;) and archive. Boom, done.</li>
<li>Resume your daily work. Do <em>not</em>, I repeat, <strong>DO NOT</strong> leave your mail client open. You should work without disturbances. Let them emails come in and sizzle a little in your inbox. If someone needs something absolutely immediately, they&#8217;ll have your phone number and give you a call.</li>
<li>Half an hour before lunch, conduct seek-and-destroy operation burrito sandwich with egg and cheese, i.e. achieve Inbox Zero again. You may want to leave the work emails until later when you&#8217;re not irritable (you&#8217;re hungry, remember?).</li>
<li>Eat lunch and laugh at animals making fools of themselves or watch an inspiring <a href="http://ted.com">TED</a> talk. Resume to work once lunch is over.</li>
<li>Take 5 minutes and reply to those work emails you put off. Resume work.</li>
<li>Half an hour before your work day ends, achieve Inbox Zero again.</li>
<li>Turn off anything on your phone that will remind you that emails exist. No notifications, no automatic push emails, no badge icons. You&#8217;ve left work and now you should spend time with you you care about.</li>

<p>Moral of the story: more frequently going through your emails throughout the work day (but in set times that make sense) is the best route. Three is good enough for me on a normal work day, but it&#8217;s more like 45 times during the school year. So many freaking emails.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, forget you have any technology whatsoever, cuddle up with schnookums (your retarded cat) and read a novel. What a great day you just had.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So there&#8217;s been a lot of hype about <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> over the past several years. For those of you who are interested in programming and programming languages, you heard about it right from the start, as its beautiful syntax and ease of use lured many programmers into its use.</p>

<p>While Ruby is wonderful, it wouldn&#8217;t be what it is today without the existence of <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. This web framework posed the first real threat to PHP. Rails was powerful and agile, and helped web devs create incredbile web apps with incredible ease. The generators that came along with this gem made it possible to get a completely functional website up in a matter of <em>hours</em>, rather than days. That was incredible.</p>

<p>I used Rails on and off, switching between it and CakePHP. I didn&#8217;t really understand Rails&#8217; routes and wanted something like CakePHP&#8217;s <code>bake</code> functionality which creates an entire scaffold with styling and everything. I didn&#8217;t object to the un-RESTful CakePHP nature of using just <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> requests, as I didn&#8217;t need the RESTful functionality for any of the sites I was creating. I used Rails for a couple projects, but it always felt like I was coding more than was necessary.</p>

<p>I started working at <a href="http://www.thinktopography.com">Think Topography</a> this summer and was tasked with building the new <a href="http://www.ithacahours.com">Ithaca Hours</a> mobile web app that would facilitate the use of Ithaca Hours. My boss had always used Rails and suggested that I use Rails for the API end of this project. It seemed like the best choice, given the requirements of the project, and so it began: I dove back into Rails.</p>

<p>Once I wrapped my head around routes and the devise/warden authentication framework, I was truckin&#8217;. I was making huge progress on this API and learning gobs of information along the way. I was loving Rails and appreciating its incredible power. I was writing tests in rspec, which was a joy when combined with factory_girl.</p>

<p>I recently worked on a project for <a href="https://www.mhusa.com/contact-tools/login.asp?c">Moët &amp; Chandon USA</a> that was built upon the CakePHP framework, and I was not nearly as excited about returning to this framework as I expected to be, given my incredible comfort with the language and the framework.</p>

<p>But my work at Think Topography has changed me &#8211; I&#8217;m a Rails guy for sure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Members of the Cornell University Glee Club and Chorus were asked to perform at a wedding on campus yesterday, and as a member of the Glee Club, I volunteered to sing. This wedding, being a Catholic one, was quite traditional, and left me feeling quite uneasy about my participation in the ceremony.</p>

<p>I have renounced any belief in the Judeo-Christian God for about 8 years. I grew up in an Episcopalian church in Rochester, NY and it was quite a liberal experience. Though I appreciate what religion can do for many around the world, I find it stifling, and often quite demeaning. As I listened to the prayers, I was overwhelmed by a feeling of unease. Questions filled my head: <em>How can anyone subject themselves to complete obedience to something of which they know so little? How can anyone find this comforting, to relinquish control to some &#8220;being&#8221; that most likely does not exist? Why do members of our society, despite incredible evidence against it, continue to believe in such an archaic set of beliefs?</em></p>

<p>I found myself wishing I could get up and leave. My heart began to race, fueled by the &#8220;fight-or-flight&#8221; instinct. I felt threatened, not only personally, but also I felt a threat to our entire society. We see, on a practically <em>daily</em> basis, how the Abrahamic religions are holding us back in many different ways. We are paralyzed by our fear that disbelief will mean condemnation, but all forget that the concepts of hell and purgatory are Medieval conceptions fabricated by the Roman Catholic Church to provoke incredible fear. These conceptions are just as despicable, just as reprehensible, as the tithe. These conceptions invoke a fear that is very real, but it has been seen time and time again that obedience caused by means of fear always falls.</p>

<p>There is hope. The population of &#8220;non-believers&#8221;, those who do not profess a belief in the God of Abraham, is growing rapidly. With the ability of science to definitively answer questions that were historically answered by religious doctrines, we are able to let our belief in the Judeo-Christian God go. We no longer need a priest, an imam or a rabbi to interpret the scriptures for us &mdash; we have scientists that can do this for us! Our scientists, their theories based upon facts (things we <em>know</em> to be true, not just a guess or a belief), have given us verifiable beliefs. Skepticism is welcomed. It is a wonderful thing to be a part of the scientific world!</p>

<p>Listening to the prayers professing ultimate devotion to some being no one actually knows, I became uneasy. Our society can do better than this. We must be determined to live in a more fact-based society… <em>we must</em>.</p>
