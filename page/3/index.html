  <div class="entry-content"><p>Higher education is messed up. The incentives for learning as well as the structure of that learning is all wrong.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s this perspective? Well, let&#8217;s define elements of this proposition. By &#8220;wrong&#8221;, i mean &#8220;not conducive to the best mastery of the material&#8221; and by &#8220;structure of that learning&#8221;, I&#8217;m talking about the overlap of classes &mdash; the simultaneous learning associated with taking more than one class during any one period of time. By &#8220;incentives&#8221;, I mean &#8220;grades&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Grades</h3>

<p>Grades suck. Just about every student who&#8217;s been evaluated and given a letter to indicate achievement will agree: tears have been shed and jobs have been lost &mdash; careers ruined &mdash; because of a letter.</p>

<p>At grade-obsessed Cornell University, the grade is the entire reason anyone seems to do anything. High grades are rewarded and low grades are punished. But how much do grades mean? Do they <em>actually</em> measure the success and mastery of the material, or do they just exist to weed out &#8220;smart&#8221; from &#8220;stupid&#8221;? I&#8217;d argue that grades say nothing about <em>true</em> mastery. Rather, they say &#8220;I can take a test well,&#8221; and &#8220;I can write you an essay you think is good.&#8221; But they don&#8217;t necessarily say, &#8220;I know this and understand every bit of it.&#8221; Too often, students memorize but don&#8217;t truly understand.</p>

<p>Teachers &mdash; at any level &mdash; should ask more questions which force students to synthesize their knowledge and undersanding and not bother trying to label the &#8220;success&#8221; with a letter. These letters try to boil a student&#8217;s worth down to an arbitrary orthographic symbol. We, the students, should learn by reading and asking questions. The more time we have alone with the material &mdash; for intraspection to develop true understanding &mdash; the more certain it is that it is true mastery we are achieving. Until the master thinks we have mastered the material, we need to continue learning and trying to understand the material.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>Structure is also a problem. We really ought to focus on <em>one</em> topic and worth with it until we have truly mastered the material. Before mastery, we must not be distracted by other things. We must imerse ourselves in the topic entirelty and not let anything get in the way of our mastery.</p>

<p>The simultaneous class system must go. Take a class, perhaps one every three or four weeks, and do not move on until it is finished and mastery has been achieved. Once one has reached the mastery equivalent to that which the professor believes is true and perfect, then a new topic can be studied. Until then, we mustn&#8217;t move on &mdash; mastery is the highest value of education.</p>

<h3>A New System</h3>

<p>This new system will guarantee that every student has the same level of mastery and develops a personal connection with the masters and the material. One topic at a time and commitment to mastery rather than arbitrary grades and skewed test results, this new system uses the intuition of the master in knowing when the student has achieved his or her potential.</p>

<p>Incentives are misaligned. It&#8217;s no longer about learning &mdash; it&#8217;s about being told you&#8217;re learning, even if you&#8217;re not. It&#8217;s time we realign incentives and learn to learn and master the material.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished up reading <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2012/08/05/managing-email-realistically/">Matt Gemmell&#8217;s post on email management</a>. If you haven&#8217;t read it, you&#8217;ll want to do make sure you head over to his site and give it a quick read before continuing.</p>

<p>Firstly, I should say that I am a manager, a developer, a web developer and a university student. I get a shit-ton of emails, so don&#8217;t think I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have developed an email attack-plan that works well for me, and I think works well for most people I know. This plan entails a seek-and-destroy method of achieving and maintaining Inbox Zero.</p>

<ol>
<li>Have a smartphone. Not only are these things super hip, but they&#8217;re handy as hell for killing off swarms of emails you get throughout the day.</li>
<li>Use your time wisely. Don&#8217;t twiddle your thumbs while on the bus/train/subway on the way to work. Rather, delete the worthless emails and read through the important ones. Re-mark them as unread until you get to the office.</li>
<li>Leverage the full keyboard. After the longest commute you&#8217;ve ever had to make, you&#8217;ve deleted or archived the bogus emails, so now you just have an inbox of awesome emails to go. Spend a half hour to an hour to get back to Inbox Zero. As Matt suggests, read the ones from your friends first &mdash; they&#8217;re always hilarious/useful/intriguing/important.</li>
<li>Go through your work emails after you&#8217;ve had a good laugh. You&#8217;ll be in a better mood when you tell the designer you&#8217;re working with that they&#8217;re crazy and you won&#8217;t come off as such a jerk. Win. Be detailed with these, but be very precise and concise - no one likes a long email.</li>
<li>Next, family. They&#8217;re usually cute and/or stupid. Send a quick reply (&#8220;Cute! Love, Parker&#8221;) and archive. Boom, done.</li>
<li>Resume your daily work. Do <em>not</em>, I repeat, <strong>DO NOT</strong> leave your mail client open. You should work without disturbances. Let them emails come in and sizzle a little in your inbox. If someone needs something absolutely immediately, they&#8217;ll have your phone number and give you a call.</li>
<li>Half an hour before lunch, conduct seek-and-destroy operation burrito sandwich with egg and cheese, i.e. achieve Inbox Zero again. You may want to leave the work emails until later when you&#8217;re not irritable (you&#8217;re hungry, remember?).</li>
<li>Eat lunch and laugh at animals making fools of themselves or watch an inspiring <a href="http://ted.com">TED</a> talk. Resume to work once lunch is over.</li>
<li>Take 5 minutes and reply to those work emails you put off. Resume work.</li>
<li>Half an hour before your work day ends, achieve Inbox Zero again.</li>
<li>Turn off anything on your phone that will remind you that emails exist. No notifications, no automatic push emails, no badge icons. You&#8217;ve left work and now you should spend time with you you care about.</li>
</ol>


<p>Moral of the story: more frequently going through your emails throughout the work day (but in set times that make sense) is the best route. Three is good enough for me on a normal work day, but it&#8217;s more like 45 times during the school year. So many freaking emails.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, forget you have any technology whatsoever, cuddle up with schnookums (your retarded cat) and read a novel. What a great day you just had.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So there&#8217;s been a lot of hype about <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> over the past several years. For those of you who are interested in programming and programming languages, you heard about it right from the start, as its beautiful syntax and ease of use lured many programmers into its use.</p>

<p>While Ruby is wonderful, it wouldn&#8217;t be what it is today without the existence of <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. This web framework posed the first real threat to PHP. Rails was powerful and agile, and helped web devs create incredbile web apps with incredible ease. The generators that came along with this gem made it possible to get a completely functional website up in a matter of <em>hours</em>, rather than days. That was incredible.</p>

<p>I used Rails on and off, switching between it and CakePHP. I didn&#8217;t really understand Rails&#8217; routes and wanted something like CakePHP&#8217;s <code>bake</code> functionality which creates an entire scaffold with styling and everything. I didn&#8217;t object to the un-RESTful CakePHP nature of using just <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> requests, as I didn&#8217;t need the RESTful functionality for any of the sites I was creating. I used Rails for a couple projects, but it always felt like I was coding more than was necessary.</p>

<p>I started working at <a href="http://www.thinktopography.com">Think Topography</a> this summer and was tasked with building the new <a href="http://www.ithacahours.com">Ithaca Hours</a> mobile web app that would facilitate the use of Ithaca Hours. My boss had always used Rails and suggested that I use Rails for the API end of this project. It seemed like the best choice, given the requirements of the project, and so it began: I dove back into Rails.</p>

<p>Once I wrapped my head around routes and the devise/warden authentication framework, I was truckin&#8217;. I was making huge progress on this API and learning gobs of information along the way. I was loving Rails and appreciating its incredible power. I was writing tests in rspec, which was a joy when combined with factory_girl.</p>

<p>I recently worked on a project for <a href="https://www.mhusa.com/contact-tools/login.asp?c">Moët &amp; Chandon USA</a> that was built upon the CakePHP framework, and I was not nearly as excited about returning to this framework as I expected to be, given my incredible comfort with the language and the framework.</p>

<p>But my work at Think Topography has changed me &#8211; I&#8217;m a Rails guy for sure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Members of the Cornell University Glee Club and Chorus were asked to perform at a wedding on campus yesterday, and as a member of the Glee Club, I volunteered to sing. This wedding, being a Catholic one, was quite traditional, and left me feeling quite uneasy about my participation in the ceremony.</p>

<p>I have renounced any belief in the Judeo-Christian God for about 8 years. I grew up in an Episcopalian church in Rochester, NY and it was quite a liberal experience. Though I appreciate what religion can do for many around the world, I find it stifling, and often quite demeaning. As I listened to the prayers, I was overwhelmed by a feeling of unease. Questions filled my head: <em>How can anyone subject themselves to complete obedience to something of which they know so little? How can anyone find this comforting, to relinquish control to some &#8220;being&#8221; that most likely does not exist? Why do members of our society, despite incredible evidence against it, continue to believe in such an archaic set of beliefs?</em></p>

<p>I found myself wishing I could get up and leave. My heart began to race, fueled by the &#8220;fight-or-flight&#8221; instinct. I felt threatened, not only personally, but also I felt a threat to our entire society. We see, on a practically <em>daily</em> basis, how the Abrahamic religions are holding us back in many different ways. We are paralyzed by our fear that disbelief will mean condemnation, but all forget that the concepts of hell and purgatory are Medieval conceptions fabricated by the Roman Catholic Church to provoke incredible fear. These conceptions are just as despicable, just as reprehensible, as the tithe. These conceptions invoke a fear that is very real, but it has been seen time and time again that obedience caused by means of fear always falls.</p>

<p>There is hope. The population of &#8220;non-believers&#8221;, those who do not profess a belief in the God of Abraham, is growing rapidly. With the ability of science to definitively answer questions that were historically answered by religious doctrines, we are able to let our belief in the Judeo-Christian God go. We no longer need a priest, an imam or a rabbi to interpret the scriptures for us &mdash; we have scientists that can do this for us! Our scientists, their theories based upon facts (things we <em>know</em> to be true, not just a guess or a belief), have given us verifiable beliefs. Skepticism is welcomed. It is a wonderful thing to be a part of the scientific world!</p>

<p>Listening to the prayers professing ultimate devotion to some being no one actually knows, I became uneasy. Our society can do better than this. We must be determined to live in a more fact-based society… <em>we must</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night, I experienced the most significant car trouble that has ever occurred while I was driving. As I and a couple friends were leaving the city of Rochester for home in our respective suburbs, I ran over a pothole that was quite large (it is Spring in a city which experiences incredible snowfall, so they are to be expected) and heard a thud and a &#8220;whooooosshhh&#8221;. I stopped the car.</p>

<p>I hopped out of the driver&#8217;s seat and inspected the vehicle. My front left tire had popped and I was now riding on the rim. No good. I turn off the car and switch into crisis mode. <em>I&#8217;ve done this before</em>, I think as I remember back to helping my father change the tire on the back of our minivan a year or so ago. The other guys in the car behind me (we had two cars, luckily) hop out to help. I grab the spare tire, jack and wrench from the trunk and begin the process. <em>Loosen the bolts. Jack up the car. Take out the bolts. Replace the tire with the spare. Reattach the bolts. Put the car back on the ground. Tighten the bolts.</em></p>

<p>As we are working on the car, we realize that the car is not on flat terrain. The road upon which we&#8217;ve stopped is an incline. We jack up the car with incredible trepidation, with two guys on the lower end of the car, applying pressure to ensure that there are no issues with the car falling from the jack and ruining the axle.</p>

<p>All goes as planned and we lower the car. Once the car is on the ground, we notice that the spare is flat! Jeebus, this is annoying. Bereft of a pump or any other way of putting air into the tire, we&#8217;re stuck. I finally cave and call AAA, only to find that I&#8217;m not on the plan and that &#8220;the plan covers [my father], not the vehicle.&#8221; After about 15 minutes of calls (it&#8217;s easily 12:15AM by this point), my father sorts it out and is able to convince AAA to add me to the plan. They give me a call and I&#8217;m (finally) able to request a tow truck. Whew, that was annoying.</p>

<p>All while I&#8217;m on the phone with AAA, I suggest to the other car that they head out (a couple of them had to wake up very early). They agree and go to leave, only to find that their car won&#8217;t start. Now this is quite a turn of events. Two cars, out-of-commision on the highway very late at night &mdash; this is how horror films start.</p>

<p>As we&#8217;re waiting for the tow truck to arrive, a friend and I are talking while keeping a look out. We see a tow truck drive by and we flag him down, but he&#8217;s not the tow truck which was called for us. A kind-hearted guy, he agrees to help us out. He maneauvers his vehicle over to where my car was disabled and inspects the spare. He pumps it up and determines that it&#8217;s not leaking! What joy! One car back to road-readiness.</p>

<p>The other tow truck arrives as we&#8217;re working to blow up my tire and he
jumps the other vehicle. All is well.</p>

<p>Couldn&#8217;t have asked to deal with this with better people. Was so glad
they were there to help. Thank my lucky stars.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a heavy user of <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>, an app that allows one to save webpages to read later. I am a subscriber, and I have chosen to keep the ads turned on, to support the creator and sole developer, <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Arment</a>, because, well, he&#8217;s a great guy and he deserves it. Marco works tirelessly to not only create something that he finds useful, but also something that might be useful to others. Thus far, Marco has done a fantastic job with Instapaper, as we have seen with his <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/10/17/instapaper-4-released">4.0 release</a>. He has added much-asked-for features, and nixed features that customers didn&#8217;t feel were useful, or downright hated. The <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8%3FpartnerId%3D30">iPhone and iPad app</a> is absolutely fantastic, no doubt about that. Today, however, my gripe is with the <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper Webapp</a>.</p>

<p>The Instapaper Webapp, the preferred way to access one&#8217;s Instapaper account from a computer, is, it is sad to say, sub-par. Being a web developer myself, I can imagine that much sophistication lies behind the webapp, but it doesn&#8217;t appear to &#8220;just work&#8221;. There are several actions which have non-intuitive outcomes, and others which are very clunky. Along this same vein, I would like to suggest improvements to the webapp that I believe to be quite reasonable, as well as necessary.</p>

<p>In the interest of time, I provide for you a list of &#8220;gripes&#8221; that I have with the Instapaper webapp:</p>

<ol>
<li>When clicking &#8220;+ Add&#8221; from a folder, it does not add the new item to the folder, but to the general &#8220;Unread&#8221; folder</li>
<li>No way to search through folders or one&#8217;s entire Instapaper library</li>
<li>Articles (as list items) are too large, therefore causing the issue that an &#8220;at-a-glance&#8221; view of the page shows only about 4 or 5 articles (MBP 15&#8221;, 1440x900 screen res)</li>
<li>No &#8220;label&#8221; concept</li>
</ol>


<h3>1: Adding an Article using &#8220;+ Add&#8221;</h3>

<p>I have a folder called &#8220;News to Read&#8221;, where I store news articles as they arrive in my inbox from various daily news digests. I was adding an article I had found to what I <em>thought</em> was this folder (I navigated to the folder, and clicked &#8220;+ Add&#8221;), and, after it didn&#8217;t appear in the folder, I was a little confused. I navigated back to &#8220;Unread&#8221;, and there it was. Needless to say, I was irked.</p>

<p>I would like to see a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> menu on the &#8220;+ Add&#8221; page that autofills with whichever folder referred me (though allows for a change, if the user desires), and that article be added to whichever folder is listed in this <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> menu. That&#8217;d be great.</p>

<h3>2:  No Searching</h3>

<p>This is actually my biggest grievance. I find the inability to search through my (>1000) articles to be quite annoying. Oftentimes, I will read an article, refer to it in a conversation and have no way to find it and send it to the person(s) with whom I discussed the article, because it is buried deeply in my archive. If there were a search bar at the top, I might be able to type in the first few words of the title or perhaps the site url (e.g., &#8220;http://www.nytimes.com/&#8221;, or just &#8220;nytimes.com&#8221;) and have a list of articles show up &#8211; a <em>much</em> easier pile of articles through which to search!</p>

<p>This could be relatively easy to implement: when a new article is saved from the iOS app or via a bookmarklet, then the Instapaper engine could construct a few keywords or tags that identify the page. For example, if &#8220;NYTimes&#8221; is in the title, it is safe to assume that the article is either from the <em>New York Times</em> or somehow relates to the <em>Times</em>. In addition to this, we could have the option of adding our own, custom tags to a saved page both via &#8220;Edit&#8221; and when using &#8220;+ Add&#8221; to add the page.</p>

<p>EDIT: Some search functionality is available for subscribers.</p>

<h3>3: Listed Articles are HUGE</h3>

<p>In this case, we want to diverge from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXRaboSo70A">Billy Fucillo&#8217;s famous line</a>, and go for &#8220;small&#8221;. The fact that I can presently see only about 4 or 5 articles in my viewport at once does not allow for any ability to scan. I tend to do this &#8211; I will scan through article titles and find something of interest and read that.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an idea: why not try creating a skin for Instapaper that looks a little like <a href="http://www.cravingtech.com/gmail-gets-compact-layout-and-better-search.html">Gmail&#8217;s new compact view</a>? Given the large number of articles I have (386 in my Unread folder, 1500 articles not in my Archive), I would love a way to perform <strong>mass actions</strong> (like &#8220;archive&#8221;, &#8220;move to folder&#8221;, &#8220;apply tags&#8221;) to various articles, and to see far more (maybe 25 or 50?) at once.</p>

<h3>4: No Concept of &#8220;Labels&#8221;</h3>

<p>This one is more a &#8220;nice-to-have&#8221; feature, but would be <em>fantastic</em>. I think Google really pioneered a different way of thinking about folders when they introduced the concept of labels into Gmail. This is a nice way to search and organize, because it is typical for one to have an article that applied to several topics they may have labeled for folders (e.g., &#8220;Tech&#8221; and &#8220;WebDev&#8221;), and allows for <em>both</em> of these labels to &#8220;house&#8221; the article. This also makes finding articles in the Archive <em>far</em> easier, because I can go to a label, click &#8220;View Archived Articles with this Label&#8221;, and see all of the archived articles with this particular label! <em>Parfait.</em></p>

<p>You would have to change <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/api/full">Instapaper&#8217;s API</a> to return an array of folders for any given bookmark, but that&#8217;s very doable. And, when getting a list of the bookmarks in a particular folder, as long as that folder&#8217;s ID is in the bookmark&#8217;s <code>belongs_to</code> array, then add it. But that&#8217;s a no-brainer.</p>

<h3>Thanks</h3>

<p>So thanks for reading. These are my improvements for <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>, one of the greatest webapps of all time. A huge &#8220;thank you&#8221; to <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco</a>, who had the forethought to create something that the rest of us didn&#8217;t even know we needed, and now, can&#8217;t imagine living without. Thanks!</p>

<p>Also, Marco, I&#8217;m free this summer to help out with implementing improvements such as these. I&#8217;m a webdev with a lot of experience with PHP-heavy apps, and have used CakePHP and CodeIgniter before, which is what I believe you have written this webapp with. But take a quick look at my <a href="http://www.parkermoore.de/">online resumé</a> for a more detailed description of my qualifications.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can&#8217;t decide whether this semester was a success or a failure. There are so many things about which I should be proud, and an almost equal number of things about which I should be ashamed or disappointed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll start with the good news first. Right as the semester began, I was accepted into the Cornell University Glee Club and The Class Notes. I am very proud to be a member of both groups and have found the members of each group to be kind, considerate, and, most of all, accepting. We have made some beautiful music this semester, and I am especially excited to compete with the Glee Club at the 2012 Choirs of the World festival in Wales this summer.</p>

<p>I have also had a relatively successful semester in terms of web development. After working on the total Leacock&#8217;s redesign this summer, I didn&#8217;t have a whole lot to do except for implement changes and the Photosets feature in the Photos section. I pursued other avenues through which I could expand my webdev experience, and was fortunate enough to have been chosen as this year&#8217;s Information Technology Manager for Hotel Ezra Cornell 87. It has been a truly rewarding experience to work with the impassioned Board of Directors to create something for HEC which is new and innovative.</p>

<p>I was also lucky enough to have been chosen to work with Terran Exchange this semester, which was the first time I had ever dabbled in a Rails application that meant something to someone. I have worked on a few projects to learn Ruby and Rails, but never had I worked on a project that was, for lack of a better term, <em>legit</em>. It was a pleasure to work with the TE team and to contribute, ever so slightly, to the project.</p>

<p>Those who know me well, know that I struggled in High School with acceptance and personal issues that posed social challenges. Knowing that I have historically struggled with this, I have been delightfully surprised with the remarkable turn-around I have shown this semester. I feel I have connected astonishingly well with those around me on campus this semester. Last year, at McGill, I did not emphasize the importance of social interaction enough, and therefore had a less-than-optimal time at McGill. But I seem to be relishing in this new institution, with its delightfully brilliant population.</p>

<p>I have talked enough about the good; consequently, it is only fitting that I discuss the bad. I am quite disappointed in my grades this semester. I have talked it over with many here and they seem to disagree. They feel that I am doing average, or even better than average in my classes. That being said, I don&#8217;t have the 3.75 that I achieved last year at McGill. I imagine that this discrepancy is merely the result of the increased difficulty of the school at which I am currently enrolled, but I definitely feel inferior to my classmates. I&#8217;m hoping it is all in my head.</p>

<p>I am disappointed in my display (or lack) of personal self- control this semester. I have certainly skipped many-a party to work on homework, but issues like timeliness still bug me to this day. For some very strange reason, getting to a meeting, a class, a rehearsal on time are still bugging me.</p>

<p>So I have told you enough about my life interesting/strange semester. Now let me offer you my solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li>ALWAYS be on time.</li>
<li>Write down and UTILIZE office hours.</li>
<li>Focus on your schoolwork - it is the reason you are here.</li>
<li>Strive to fully understand what you are learning - don&#8217;t just commit to rote memory.</li>
<li>Find balance between challenging and not-so-challenging courses so as not to overload yourself.</li>
<li>Develop a routine and stick with it.</li>
<li>Be happy with who you are and always strive to work your very hardest. You are capable of succeeding at Cornell, you just need to be more comprehensive in your approach.</li>
<li>DO NOT SQUANDER AWAY TIME.</li>
<li>Limit the number of blogs you subscribe to. &#8220;Lifehacker&#8221; will not actually help you in school. Just glance at their  highlights when and if you have a free minute.</li>
<li>Sleep. If you organize and schedule your time appropriately, this will not be an issue.</li>
</ol>


<p>There you have it. A couple personal goals for me to work toward next semester. Thanks for reading.</p>
