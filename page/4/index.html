  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a heavy user of <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>, an app that allows one to save webpages to read later. I am a subscriber, and I have chosen to keep the ads turned on, to support the creator and sole developer, <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Arment</a>, because, well, he&#8217;s a great guy and he deserves it. Marco works tirelessly to not only create something that he finds useful, but also something that might be useful to others. Thus far, Marco has done a fantastic job with Instapaper, as we have seen with his <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/10/17/instapaper-4-released">4.0 release</a>. He has added much-asked-for features, and nixed features that customers didn&#8217;t feel were useful, or downright hated. The <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8%3FpartnerId%3D30">iPhone and iPad app</a> is absolutely fantastic, no doubt about that. Today, however, my gripe is with the <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper Webapp</a>.</p>

<p>The Instapaper Webapp, the preferred way to access one&#8217;s Instapaper account from a computer, is, it is sad to say, sub-par. Being a web developer myself, I can imagine that much sophistication lies behind the webapp, but it doesn&#8217;t appear to &#8220;just work&#8221;. There are several actions which have non-intuitive outcomes, and others which are very clunky. Along this same vein, I would like to suggest improvements to the webapp that I believe to be quite reasonable, as well as necessary.</p>

<p>In the interest of time, I provide for you a list of &#8220;gripes&#8221; that I have with the Instapaper webapp:</p>

<ol>
<li>When clicking &#8220;+ Add&#8221; from a folder, it does not add the new item to the folder, but to the general &#8220;Unread&#8221; folder</li>
<li>No way to search through folders or one&#8217;s entire Instapaper library</li>
<li>Articles (as list items) are too large, therefore causing the issue that an &#8220;at-a-glance&#8221; view of the page shows only about 4 or 5 articles (MBP 15&#8221;, 1440x900 screen res)</li>
<li>No &#8220;label&#8221; concept</li>
</ol>


<h3>1: Adding an Article using &#8220;+ Add&#8221;</h3>

<p>I have a folder called &#8220;News to Read&#8221;, where I store news articles as they arrive in my inbox from various daily news digests. I was adding an article I had found to what I <em>thought</em> was this folder (I navigated to the folder, and clicked &#8220;+ Add&#8221;), and, after it didn&#8217;t appear in the folder, I was a little confused. I navigated back to &#8220;Unread&#8221;, and there it was. Needless to say, I was irked.</p>

<p>I would like to see a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> menu on the &#8220;+ Add&#8221; page that autofills with whichever folder referred me (though allows for a change, if the user desires), and that article be added to whichever folder is listed in this <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> menu. That&#8217;d be great.</p>

<h3>2:  No Searching</h3>

<p>This is actually my biggest grievance. I find the inability to search through my (>1000) articles to be quite annoying. Oftentimes, I will read an article, refer to it in a conversation and have no way to find it and send it to the person(s) with whom I discussed the article, because it is buried deeply in my archive. If there were a search bar at the top, I might be able to type in the first few words of the title or perhaps the site url (e.g., &#8220;http://www.nytimes.com/&#8221;, or just &#8220;nytimes.com&#8221;) and have a list of articles show up &#8211; a <em>much</em> easier pile of articles through which to search!</p>

<p>This could be relatively easy to implement: when a new article is saved from the iOS app or via a bookmarklet, then the Instapaper engine could construct a few keywords or tags that identify the page. For example, if &#8220;NYTimes&#8221; is in the title, it is safe to assume that the article is either from the <em>New York Times</em> or somehow relates to the <em>Times</em>. In addition to this, we could have the option of adding our own, custom tags to a saved page both via &#8220;Edit&#8221; and when using &#8220;+ Add&#8221; to add the page.</p>

<p>EDIT: Some search functionality is available for subscribers.</p>

<h3>3: Listed Articles are HUGE</h3>

<p>In this case, we want to diverge from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXRaboSo70A">Billy Fucillo&#8217;s famous line</a>, and go for &#8220;small&#8221;. The fact that I can presently see only about 4 or 5 articles in my viewport at once does not allow for any ability to scan. I tend to do this &#8211; I will scan through article titles and find something of interest and read that.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an idea: why not try creating a skin for Instapaper that looks a little like <a href="http://www.cravingtech.com/gmail-gets-compact-layout-and-better-search.html">Gmail&#8217;s new compact view</a>? Given the large number of articles I have (386 in my Unread folder, 1500 articles not in my Archive), I would love a way to perform <strong>mass actions</strong> (like &#8220;archive&#8221;, &#8220;move to folder&#8221;, &#8220;apply tags&#8221;) to various articles, and to see far more (maybe 25 or 50?) at once.</p>

<h3>4: No Concept of &#8220;Labels&#8221;</h3>

<p>This one is more a &#8220;nice-to-have&#8221; feature, but would be <em>fantastic</em>. I think Google really pioneered a different way of thinking about folders when they introduced the concept of labels into Gmail. This is a nice way to search and organize, because it is typical for one to have an article that applied to several topics they may have labeled for folders (e.g., &#8220;Tech&#8221; and &#8220;WebDev&#8221;), and allows for <em>both</em> of these labels to &#8220;house&#8221; the article. This also makes finding articles in the Archive <em>far</em> easier, because I can go to a label, click &#8220;View Archived Articles with this Label&#8221;, and see all of the archived articles with this particular label! <em>Parfait.</em></p>

<p>You would have to change <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/api/full">Instapaper&#8217;s API</a> to return an array of folders for any given bookmark, but that&#8217;s very doable. And, when getting a list of the bookmarks in a particular folder, as long as that folder&#8217;s ID is in the bookmark&#8217;s <code>belongs_to</code> array, then add it. But that&#8217;s a no-brainer.</p>

<h3>Thanks</h3>

<p>So thanks for reading. These are my improvements for <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>, one of the greatest webapps of all time. A huge &#8220;thank you&#8221; to <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco</a>, who had the forethought to create something that the rest of us didn&#8217;t even know we needed, and now, can&#8217;t imagine living without. Thanks!</p>

<p>Also, Marco, I&#8217;m free this summer to help out with implementing improvements such as these. I&#8217;m a webdev with a lot of experience with PHP-heavy apps, and have used CakePHP and CodeIgniter before, which is what I believe you have written this webapp with. But take a quick look at my <a href="http://www.parkermoore.de/">online resumé</a> for a more detailed description of my qualifications.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can&#8217;t decide whether this semester was a success or a failure. There are so many things about which I should be proud, and an almost equal number of things about which I should be ashamed or disappointed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll start with the good news first. Right as the semester began, I was accepted into the Cornell University Glee Club and The Class Notes. I am very proud to be a member of both groups and have found the members of each group to be kind, considerate, and, most of all, accepting. We have made some beautiful music this semester, and I am especially excited to compete with the Glee Club at the 2012 Choirs of the World festival in Wales this summer.</p>

<p>I have also had a relatively successful semester in terms of web development. After working on the total Leacock&#8217;s redesign this summer, I didn&#8217;t have a whole lot to do except for implement changes and the Photosets feature in the Photos section. I pursued other avenues through which I could expand my webdev experience, and was fortunate enough to have been chosen as this year&#8217;s Information Technology Manager for Hotel Ezra Cornell 87. It has been a truly rewarding experience to work with the impassioned Board of Directors to create something for HEC which is new and innovative.</p>

<p>I was also lucky enough to have been chosen to work with Terran Exchange this semester, which was the first time I had ever dabbled in a Rails application that meant something to someone. I have worked on a few projects to learn Ruby and Rails, but never had I worked on a project that was, for lack of a better term, <em>legit</em>. It was a pleasure to work with the TE team and to contribute, ever so slightly, to the project.</p>

<p>Those who know me well, know that I struggled in High School with acceptance and personal issues that posed social challenges. Knowing that I have historically struggled with this, I have been delightfully surprised with the remarkable turn-around I have shown this semester. I feel I have connected astonishingly well with those around me on campus this semester. Last year, at McGill, I did not emphasize the importance of social interaction enough, and therefore had a less-than-optimal time at McGill. But I seem to be relishing in this new institution, with its delightfully brilliant population.</p>

<p>I have talked enough about the good; consequently, it is only fitting that I discuss the bad. I am quite disappointed in my grades this semester. I have talked it over with many here and they seem to disagree. They feel that I am doing average, or even better than average in my classes. That being said, I don&#8217;t have the 3.75 that I achieved last year at McGill. I imagine that this discrepancy is merely the result of the increased difficulty of the school at which I am currently enrolled, but I definitely feel inferior to my classmates. I&#8217;m hoping it is all in my head.</p>

<p>I am disappointed in my display (or lack) of personal self- control this semester. I have certainly skipped many-a party to work on homework, but issues like timeliness still bug me to this day. For some very strange reason, getting to a meeting, a class, a rehearsal on time are still bugging me.</p>

<p>So I have told you enough about my life interesting/strange semester. Now let me offer you my solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li>ALWAYS be on time.</li>
<li>Write down and UTILIZE office hours.</li>
<li>Focus on your schoolwork - it is the reason you are here.</li>
<li>Strive to fully understand what you are learning - don&#8217;t just commit to rote memory.</li>
<li>Find balance between challenging and not-so-challenging courses so as not to overload yourself.</li>
<li>Develop a routine and stick with it.</li>
<li>Be happy with who you are and always strive to work your very hardest. You are capable of succeeding at Cornell, you just need to be more comprehensive in your approach.</li>
<li>DO NOT SQUANDER AWAY TIME.</li>
<li>Limit the number of blogs you subscribe to. &#8220;Lifehacker&#8221; will not actually help you in school. Just glance at their  highlights when and if you have a free minute.</li>
<li>Sleep. If you organize and schedule your time appropriately, this will not be an issue.</li>
</ol>


<p>There you have it. A couple personal goals for me to work toward next semester. Thanks for reading.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a diligent member of the Web Dev &amp; Tech community, I have subscribed to a number of weekly newsletters that focus on a particular programming language (such as the much beloved <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby Weekly</a>) or a particular occupation (e.g. Devops Weekly). Despite this great abundance of weekly tech newsletters, I look forward to no newsletter more than Hacker Newsletter.</p>

<p>First and foremost, the newsletter is intelligently &amp; beautifully designed. It&#8217;s very readable, very well-organized and simply perfect for my scatter-brained mind to parse through and enjoy. <a href="http://www.kaledavis.com/">Kale Davis</a>, the curator of Hacker Newsletter, does a spectacular job of rounding up important news stories, new &amp; noteworthy libraries &amp; such, and great examples of awesome things people are doing on the web.</p>

<p>Austin, of MailChimp, <a href="http://blog.mailchimp.com/customer-love-hacker-newsletter/">couldn&#8217;t have said it better</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In an age where information comes via an increasingly overwhelming deluge, Hacker Newsletter combines relevant tech topics with discerning curation. Founder and web-app builder Kale Davis does the work so you can catch up on all the important topics developers are talking about in one easily digestible email.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t signed up for Hacker Newsletter yet, <a href="http://www.hackernewsletter.com/">do so immediately</a>! No time to waste!</p>

<p>Brilliant job, Kale. Keep &#8216;em coming!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I write this, Cornell&#8217;s network is down. It happened at about midnight - all of a sudden, everyone was receiving timeout errors and refused connection errors. I had some more offline work to do, so it didn&#8217;t worry me too much, but I found myself anxious. I was anxious about the fact that I couldn&#8217;t connect. In mere moments, the full realization that my connection to the world at large (alas, I have a dumb phone) was severed. After a minute or two of contemplation, I felt an overwhelming sense of calm: the world that I am in &mdash; the world of Cornell, and of Ithaca &mdash; was still very much accessible to me. The lack of an internet connection didn&#8217;t stop me from going down to the café and enjoying a cappuccino and a nice book, nor did it hinder my ability to see those I care most about here. I felt at peace.</p>

<p>In addition to a newfound realization for what is around me here at Cornell, the internet&#8217;s incessant nagging was finally put to rest. No more &#8220;1 Unread Message&#8221; or &#8220;248 Articles to Read&#8221;. My lack of connection with the world was, for a moment, a wonderful escape from the unending barrage of information the internet presents on a daily basis.</p>

<p>This got me thinking. Born in the early nineties, I have always known the internet. In fact, I have never known a world without the internet, the personal computer, cell phones, and much more. I am truly a child of the information age. But have I been missing out on something? Constantly battling the perpetual influx of emails, tweets, status updates, and so forth, I wonder if I lose sight of ourselves. Moreover, I wonder if <em>we</em> lose sight of <em>ourselves</em>. (I know I&#8217;m not alone when it comes to the relentless flow of information heading my way.) I have a moment, indeed many moments, to truly self-reflect. This, I do believe, is what my generation lacks the most: time for self-reflection.</p>

<p>Thus, I challenge you today, to turn off your internet for an hour, or perhaps two. You may find yourself delighted to see what is awaiting you on the other side.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was reading <em>Teens in Tech</em>&#8217;s <a href="http://teensintech.com/blog/2011/10/social-business-math-class/">blog post</a> about how student entrepreneurs ought to manage their business while they are at school and in class. I have to disagree a bit with what <a href="http://twitter.com/benpaster">Ben Paster</a> advised we do.</p>

<p>Ben implicitly encouraged the use of every moment of downtime to answer support tweets and emails and to purchase a smart phone to help do this on-the-go. Though this seems like a great idea on the surface, I would strongly advise <em>against</em> this. For one, you begin to allow these minor issues to follow you around. I opt to keep all of my business emails in a place that is, yes, readily accessible, but also out of sight. While at school, and especially in high school, the distraction of a smartphone certainly means that the student will not be fully absorbing all of the information he or she is being taught. Few students, even those of the entrepreneurial type, have the self-control to keep the phone out of sight, even during class. An entrepreneur may be brilliant and resourceful in his or her area of business, but may not grasp the meaning being extracted from <em>A Raisin&#8217; In The Sun</em> or <em>Hamlet</em> during English class if he or she is also trying to answer support queries at the same time. I know from personal experience that a distracted student is usually not a very good one.</p>

<p>I would also argue that the phone would be a distraction not only in class but also out of it. I see it all the time: two friends walking next to each other, one speaking, the other trying to listen and text at the same time. That will certainly put a damper on your relationships with friends. Same goes for the relationships with your family members. Trust me: the smartphone can be used for good, but will often just get in your way.</p>

<p>So my advice to the student entrepreneur: find a way to be able to tuck the constant barrage of information away while enjoying life and learning. They don&#8217;t need to be instantly answered - take the night off, go see a movie and enjoy being with your friends or family. You deserve it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was just hopping around the net and found the following video wherein Paul Irish shows us how to utilize some pretty awesome features built into Google Chrome&#8217;s Console (and one each in Opera and Firebug, just for fun). Quick video, awesome stuff. Thought I&#8217;d share.</p>
