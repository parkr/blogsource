This post describes what it is like to be a programmer with ADD and some strategies I&#39;ve developed to help make myself more effective.</p> <p>To solve complex problems by programmatic means, one needs to be able to focus. To find the best solution to any problem, one needs to be able to focus. In short, an effective worker is one who can focus.</p> <p>For those of us who live with the difficulties of AD(H)D every day, this fact - this dependence upon a kind of mental discipline - is glaringly obvious. Our constant struggle to focus means we are not as efficient as our non-ADD peers when asked to complete a single task. We get distracted by the sound of the wind, the tap of a colleague&#39;s fingers on his desk, or the sound of people talking walking past our window. The slightest noise or change (by a separate entity) in the visual landscape will cause us to loose our train of thought nearly immediately.</p> <p>For those of you who can focus relatively easily in distracting environments, I offer this metaphor to help you understand a bit more of how it is it live with such an affliction. Imagine you are swimming in a lake with a basketball. The depth at which you swim is your level of concentration - the deeper you swim, the more focused you are and thus the less susceptible to distraction you are. Imagine further that a day&#39;s worth of work is like swimming the length of the lake, and your goal is to swim as deeply as possible for as far as possible. The problem is that you have to do all this while holding onto the fully-inflated basketball. The longer you swim underwater, the harder it is to keep the ball (and yourself) deep underwater. During your swim from one end of the lake to the other, you are pulled up to the surface very frequently, only able to keep the ball underground for a short while at a time. This is what it&#39;s like to live and work with ADD.</p> <p>The inability to focus on a given problem for more than a few minutes at a time causes severe problems for all employees with ADD, but especially for developers who have to delve into a problem, process it, and produce a solution quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>The effectiveness of various solutions will vary person to person, but these helped me:</p> <ul> <li>Find a quiet, solitary place to work (avoid working in a place where people socialize)</li> <li>Turn off all notifications when working (fetch updates at will instead)</li> <li>Play calm, simple music without words, or work in a place where the background noise doesn&#39;t change</li> <li>Keep the room cool in temperature</li> <li>Work on one thing at a time and work until it is completed</li> <li>Plan out finer details for a large project</li> <li>Get enough sleep</li> <li>Medicate with some sort of stimulant</li> <li>Keep your workspace empty of clutter and visual distraction</li> <li>Keep snacks by your desk (like almonds or dried fruits) to keep your energy up throughout the day</li> <li>Exercise to exhaustion at least every other day</li> <li>Consciously avoid doing several things at once, like listening to a YouTube Lecture and checking your Twitter feed on your phone at the same time</li> <li>Avoid depressants like alcohol</li> <li>Write or engage in a creative, exciting activity which asks for your full concentration</li> </ul> <p>Following all of these with ADD can even be a challenge, but limiting the frequency of distracting stimuli goes a long way to achieving focus and increasing your productivity.</p> <p>If you have other suggestions, hit me up on <a href="http://alpha.app.net/parkr">ADN</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/parkr">Twitter</a>.

This was the first time I had ever watched a Senate session from the beginning and, to my surprise, they began with a prayer.</p> <p>Hold up. A prayer? In a session of one of our government&#39;s highest legislative bodies?! I suppose I shouldn&#39;t be too surprised, what with the (often crazy) Religious Right getting after the government with Bible-backed policies and all. It was nevertheless astonishing to see the institutionalization of religion in our government.</p> <p>I generally like our government, but this changes everything. Man, I was angry. I felt betrayed and undermined - like I was worth nothing to anyone in D.C.</p> <p>So I wrote to my senators:</p> <blockquote> <p>Dear Senator,</p> <p>I wish to ask for the Senator&#39;s thoughts on the opening prayer which begins a Senate session. I have done my research and see that this prayer has been a part of Senate procedure since 1789 and was recommended by Benjamin Franklin about two years previous, but I question its place in our secular government. It is, frankly, inappropriate that any governmental body in our United States of America be so closely tied to one religious creed in a nation with many hundreds and thousands of religious belief systems. I will not deny that religion is a part of politics - a belief in a certain religious creed often results in an election win - but it has absolutely no place in governance. It is insulting to think that any one religion is given special treatment in our governments.</p> <p>I ask the Senator to introduce a bill which will put an end to this Senate Prayer, for, while Mr. Franklin may have been right in 1789, he is most certainly wrong now. We have moved past a blind reliance on God, and it is, now more than ever, a hindrance on our Great Government. God&#39;s interference in our government has forced limited civil rights for minorities, was a rationale for slavery, and is still fighting against a Woman&#39;s Right to Choose, a Citizen&#39;s Right To Marry Whomever He or She Wishes, Scientific Advancement in many fields and so on.</p> <p>It is our imperative as citizens to think of each other first and to respect the different viewpoints and beliefs of our fellow Americans. Honoring any religion on our Senate floor is a betrayal of this principle, and it must be stopped.</p> <p>Thank you,<br /> Parker Moore<br /> Constituent</p> </blockquote> <p>If you care about religious freedom at all, I would urge you to do the same.</p> </div> </article> <article> <header> <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2013/05/06/jekyll-1-dot-0-released/">Jekyll 1.0 Released</a></h1> <p class="meta"> <time datetime="2013-05-06T00:59:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 6<span>th</span>, 2013</time> </p> </header> <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I&#39;m proud to announce the release of Jekyll 1.0. There are a million goodies and fixes to enjoy, and we&#39;re (the still-active Jekyll core team members: Tom, Matt and I) really excited to share this first major release with you. Be sure to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/jekyllrb">@jekyllrb</a> for updates on future releases and links to cool plugins.</p> <p>Some quick highlights:</p> <ul> <li>New subcommands: new, build, serve, and import</li> <li>Amazing new docs at http://jekyllrb.com (thanks to @cobyism)</li> <li><code>jekyll new</code> creates a new scaffold so you can get blogging even faster</li> <li>Drafts, i.e. posts without dates</li> <li>New &quot;excerpt&quot; feature on posts</li> <li>Timezone configuration</li> <li>&#39;gist&#39; liquid tag</li> <li>Source directory protection</li> </ul> <p>... and <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/v1.0.0/History.txt">so much more</a>!</p> <p>We also have an <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/">Upgrading</a> page that clarifies some breaking changes and tips for upgrading to Jekyll 1.0.</p> <p>As many of you know, Jekyll lay mostly stagnant for quite some time. At 0.11.2 and 0.12.0, it was pretty stable. It had some annoying bugs, but nothing much that couldn&#39;t be worked around or monkey-patched.</p> <p>After using Jekyll last summer to help build <a href="http://cals.cornell.edu">Cornell&#39;s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences website</a>, I took a renewed interest in seeing this project move forward. Last December, Tom answered my offers to help with the development of Jekyll by adding me as a contributor. I&#39;m happy to say that it has come a long way since then, and I&#39;m very proud to be a part of a team that has pushed this project to new heights.</p> <p>Thank you to everyone who submitted a pull request, and/or gave me advice along the way. It has been great fun so far, and I look forward to working with you all to push out future versions!</p> </div> </article> <article> <header> <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2013/04/30/an-afterlife/">An Afterlife?</a></h1> <p class="meta"> <time datetime="2013-04-30T19:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 30<span>th</span>, 2013</time> </p> </header> <div class="entry-content"><p>I am not a religious man, yet I find myself curious about the prospect of an afterlife. Is there something beyond this life, in this dimension, in this universe? While I don&#39;t believe in the traditional conception of an afterlife (one&#39;s soul ascends to a blissful place, where it inhabits all space and time for eternity), I do like to think we live on beyond the time we take our last breath.</p> <p>In ninth grade, I graduated to a Sunday School class which resembled a forum &mdash; discussion-based learning. A retired history teacher, a Public Defender, and a social worker led the discussions in this class. The dialogue probed our most deeply held beliefs and asked profound questions about life, spirituality, goodness, happiness, beauty, and other similar topics.</p> <p>One day, we were discussing the afterlife. The normal answers dominated the conversation: &quot;When one dies, one&#39;s soul ascends into Heaven to be with one&#39;s family members and with God,&quot; and &quot;We exist everywhere and with everyone. We watch over those we love and help them live good lives.&quot; When the question came to me, I wasn&#39;t sure how to respond. Can an atheist believe in an afterlife? If so, did I?</p> <p>I hadn&#39;t given it much thought before, but I pondered it for a moment and concluded, &quot;An individual&#39;s afterlife is the culmination of the memories others have of the individual. It is the legacy that individual leaves behind and the impact that individual had on those he or she encountered.&quot;</p> <p>The more I thought about it, the more it made sense. If we don&#39;t have souls, how do we explain this legacy of the afterlife concretely? The afterlife is not something experienced by the deceased individual, but by everyone else he or she impacted.</p> <p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='&#8220;They say you die twice, once when your heart stops beating, and again when your name is said for the last time.&#8221;'> I have not yet met anyone else who holds this belief I hold, but I invite you to explore it and see of you can reconcile it with your beliefs about the afterlife. Banksy once famously said (paraphrased by a friend): &quot;They say you die twice, once when your heart stops beating, and again when your name is said for the last time.&quot; I can&#39;t believe there is something I will experience beyond my death, but I can believe that others will experience their memories of me beyond my departure from this world. </span></p> </div> </article> <article> <header> <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2013/04/22/we-mustnt-idle/">We Mustn't Idle</a></h1> <p class="meta"> <time datetime="2013-04-22T02:12:12-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 22<span>nd</span>, 2013</time> </p> </header> <div class="entry-content"><p>Our legacies on this Beautiful Earth are inextricably tied to the work we do, the principles we stand for and the messages we spread. The apathetic nature of many of my peers nowadays is heresy to the nth degree, and we can no longer stand idly by and watch young people refusing to talk about the hard issues. If we’re to make any progress and maintain this More Perfect Union, we had better get our act together and stand and fight for the things we believe in.</p> <p>It comes with a price, however. We must be informed. We must read the arguments of the other side, debate them and reformulate our stance given the new evidence. In the same way Newton used this inductive methods to formulate his three famous Natural Laws, we must start with a problem we observe in our society, generalize a solution in the form of legislation, judicial action or grassroots campaigning, and revise our message as new information becomes available.</p> <p>It is not enough to let Gov majors, English majors and law students run the country, making sweeping decisions about how we may live our lives. It is not enough to defer to those with means and wealth – those with the ability to run a traditional campaign for public office and influence those in public office – in fact, it is the worst offense to this Great Nation to allow the aristocracy of special interets to continue determining the rule of law. We must stand up, as citizens, and fight for what sparks fire in our bellies! We must stand up, as citizens, and say “enough is enough” to special interests and lobbyists who control Washington. Now is our time. If our country is to change for the better, it will be because we – the citizens – made our voices heard and fought with much gnashing of teeth for what we believe in and what we know is right.</p> <p>This is the imperative of our generation. Let us act!</p> <p>This post was originally published on <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/d5bf40927b1a">Medium</a>.</p> </div> </article> <article> <header> <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2013/02/11/downtime-is-good/">Downtime Is Good</a></h1> <p class="meta"> <time datetime="2013-02-11T22:43:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 11<span>th</span>, 2013</time> </p> </header> <div class="entry-content"><p>I just started working as an intern at 6Wunderkinder a couple weeks ago. I am by no means an expert in devops (hell, I have only dabbled with a little sysadmin in the past - nothing too serious) and I don&#39;t really know what goes into keeping a huge series of server up and running. I can say, however, that I know the customer&#39;s side of things. I know what it&#39;s like to be a user of a service which periodically goes through downtimes of noticable lengths. (I know I&#39;m not the only one here so you will probably relate to this observation as well.</p> <p>So today there was a blip of downtime for Wunderlist, a really awesome task- management application by 6Wunderkinder. During this downtime, it occurred to me: downtime can help the visibility of an application or service.</p> <p>Hear me out: when the service is running smoothly, few will actually talk about it. When it goes down, Twitter blows up with complaints and &quot;ZOMG MY LIFE IS OVER&quot; tweets. These tweets, in a way, promote the service. The more frustrated the tweet, the more apparent it is that the tweeter cares about this service.</p> <p>As one who sees these frustrated tweets often about many services, I can only conclude that a little downtime here and there is a great way for outsiders to gauge how awesome a service is: if it goes down and people are upset, then the service is probably worth trying out (once it goes back up again). If the service goes down and no one cares, then it probably isn&#39;t worth your time.</p> <p>So next time you see angry tweets, write down the name of that service and check it out once everything is back in order. In all likelihood, you will like the service, too, and you&#39;ll be angrily tweeting next time it goes down.</p> <p>It&#39;s all about perspective.</p> </div> </article> <article> <header> <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/2013/02/06/install-rbenv-on-ubuntu-12-dot-04/">Install Rbenv on Ubuntu 12.04</a></h1> <p class="meta"> <time datetime="2013-02-06T21:31:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 6<span>th</span>, 2013</time> </p> </header> <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I&#39;ll admit it: I absolutely adore rbenv.</p> <p>In light of this, I&#39;ve been using it at my work at 6Wunderkinder the past couple weeks. 6W uses AWS like nobody&#39;s business, and the Ubuntu EC2 instances I&#39;ve been interacting with are really bare-bones.

Which was obviously false.</p> <p>So, I tweeted about it. Expecting a several-day delay in my support query from simyo, I totally resigned to wait on mobile data until they got back to me. But luckily this new 6W family &amp; friends totally came to my rescue. <a href="http://rafifyalda.id.au/">Rafif Yalda</a>, a former Wunderkind, totally came to my rescue in a tweet (which has since been removed).</p> <p>So if you ever run into a problem with your mobile network, ensure that your APN settings are correct. In this case:</p> <figure class='code-highlight-figure'><div class='code-highlight'><pre class='code-highlight-pre'><div data-line='1' class='code-highlight-row numbered'><div class='code-highlight-line'>APN: internet.eplus.de

To be fair to everyone, I&#39;ve listed them in alphabetical order.</p> <p>I know some apps are missing links to various versions, but if I didn&#39;t use it, then I felt it was best not to include a link to it on this list.</p> <h3>101 Airborne (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/101-airborne/id531317549?mt=8">iPhone</a>)</h3> <p>At this moment, this is one of only two games which I have installed on my iPhone. I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game, and it is incredibly well-done, to boot.</p> <h3>Diet Coda (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/diet-coda/id500906297?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3> <p>When I had to have the logic board in my MacBook Pro replaced, I had to hand in my computer for a week. I am practically addicted to development, and this app by Panic, Inc. of Portland, Oregon, served me well during those tough times.</p> <h3>Dropbox (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/install">Mac</a>)</h3> <p>Dropbox gives me the freedom to aimlessly roam between devices without losing any progress. I can work on my mac for a bit, then pick up my iPad and resume my work right then and there. Dropbox far surpasses the ease-of-use of competitors such as Box.com, and its native Mac application is far less intrusive, as well.</p> <h3>Google+ (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google+/id447119634?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3> <p>I&#39;m a social media weirdo. I have to try out every one that comes along. I even tried out <a href="http://app.net">app.net</a> for a while (I still have an account there). I started using this app far more after the amazing redesign which happened right around Christmastime. It was indeed an enjoyable occasion. I use G+ to stay in contact with friends who now work at Google and with friends of mine who insist on Google-only living: an Android phone, Google+ to communicate (Messenger), and Google Docs to collaborate.</p> <h3>Google Chrome (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chrome/id535886823?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Mac</a>)</h3> <p>Chrome on Mac is absolutely awesome. I use it obsessively.</p> <p>Chrome on the iPhone is something I had to warm up to a bit more. It behaves far differently than Safari on iOS and the controls are in completely different places. After some adjustment, I&#39;ve come to appreciate its incredible flexibility and strength in the mobile realm.</p> <h3>Google Maps (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3> <p>Apple Maps has yet to lead me to a hospital that isn&#39;t there, or on a road that has been demolished, but I still missed the Google Maps speed and accuracy. I have also found that Google Maps is far better for finding nearby amenities, such as coffee, gas, and food.</p> <h3>Google Translate (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-translate/id414706506?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3> <p>While I am relatively proficient in the language, learning German is a process. I have found this app very helpful during my studies and even when having a causal conversation over Skype in German.</p> <h3>Gmail (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-from-google/id422689480?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3> <p>As with G+ above, the redesign really did it for me. It was, all of a sudden, a reliable, beautiful, and agile experience, to use this app. It was incredibly buggy before (it seemed to be a product from Google&#39;s insistence that online mobile apps will be dominant, over native apps), but it has come a long way.</p> <h3>iA Writer (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id392502056?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id439623248?mt=12">Mac</a>)</h3> <p>Whenever I have a thought that I want to remember and ponder later, I write it down in a note. This usually happens while I am on-the-go. I will then come back later and review my thoughts and ideas in iA Writer for Mac. I am so thankful that iA Writer offers syncing through services like iCloud and Dropbox.</p> <p>I have even been known to write essays on my iPhone of 1000+ words while I walk between classes, to dinner in Collegetown, and to and from rehearsals. Two of the three &quot;A&quot; papers I wrote last year (one writes few papers when studying engineering) were written almost entirely in iA Writer for iOS.</p> <h3>Instapaper (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3> <p>After much consideration, I decided to include this app on my list. I have used Instapaper for many years now, and have truly enjoyed using it. It has, unforunately, become a repository for articles I&#39;d like to read, but probably never will. I found Instapaper very useful, however, to pass the time during long plane/car/bus rides, as well as long layovers between flights.</p> <h3>iTerm2 (<a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">Mac</a>)</h3> <p>Almost all of my development before May this year was done in Terminal.app. While I have appreciated its service, I decided to move on to iTerm2 upon a recommendation from a friend. iTerm2 is light and doesn&#39;t have any weird &quot;Mac baggage&quot; which Terminal.app does. It&#39;s simple to configure (though there are far too many configuration options, in my opinion), and easy to use.</p> <h3>Lightroom 4 (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html">Mac</a>)</h3> <p>When I first got my Mac, I bought Apple&#39;s Aperture to handle photo editing and management. When Lightroom 1 came out, I gave it a try and really enjoyed how lightweight it felt. It&#39;s incredibly easy to use, and its catalogs are quite small, relative to Aperture&#39;s. It is easily extendible, with custom plugins for exporting photos and custom presets for one-click photo editing. I&#39;ve since stayed with Lightroom, and never looked back.</p> <h3>Netflix (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3> <p>I have a slight obsession with Star Trek: The Next Generation, and, more recently, with Star Trek: Voyager. Netflix has been a wonderful means of distraction when I need to escape to the twenty-fourth century for some R &amp; R.</p> <h3>Pages (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id361309726?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id409201541?mt=12">Mac</a>)</h3> <p>Pages is similar to iA Writer, but built for presentation-geared reports and papers. If the formatting matters, Pages is there to save the day. I wrote quite a few lab reports on Pages for iOS.</p> <h3>Paper (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id361309726?mt=8">iPad</a>)</h3> <p>Paper by FiftyThree is pretty freakin&#39; awesome. It&#39;s incredibly agile, and very robust. While I am no artist, it&#39;s great for drawing up a quick website mock-up and sending it off to colleagues. I am still in search of the right stylus, however &mdash; I am using the Bamboo stylus from Wacom, but I need a tip which has more precision for use with Paper. Let me know if you know of one I should pick up.</p> <h3>Sparrow (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sparrow/id492573565?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sparrow/id417250177?mt=12">Mac</a>)</h3> <p>I have been using Sparrow since its private beta days, and I just love the thing. Sparrow for Mac is a beaut&#39; and Sparrow for iOS makes managing my Gmail accounts so easy and painless, it&#39;s almost too good to be true.</p> <h3>Spotify (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotify/id324684580?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="http://www.spotify.com/us/download/mac/">Mac</a>)</h3> <p>Unfortunately, I am not made of money, and my bank account resembles that which one might expect of a poor college student. In my hopes to spend less on music, I signed up for Spotify and have just loved it. I have discovered several new artists that I have come to adore (can it get better than some Babyface or Marc Broussard??), and for that, I am thankful. Spotify for iOS is a bit weird when trying to initialize radio on a 3G connection, but it&#39;s something I am willing to live with for the time being.</p> <h3>TextMate 2 Alpha (<a href="http://blog.macromates.com/2011/textmate-2-0-alpha/">Mac</a>)</h3> <p>As I mentioned above, I code endlessly. My trusty companion is TextMate 2. In 2006, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140207135007/http://blog.dcxn.com/">Nick Rowe</a> showed me what would become the text editor to change my world. After learning all the key bindings, it was hard to switch when I started learning more about vim. So I stuck with TextMate. When TextMate 2 Alpha came out, I was never happier. Rebuilt from the ground up, it has all the memory management I could have hoped for out of TextMate 1. I love this app with all of my heart.</p> <h3>Things 2 (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotify/id324684580?mt=8">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things/id407951449?mt=12">Mac</a>)</h3> <p>Pretty much the only reason I&#39;ve been productive this year is due to Things. I was a beta tester for Things Cloud and Things 2 (both Mac and iOS) and was delighted to find that this task-management application suite so quickly synced all of my tasks, and <em>never</em> failed. I&#39;ve never lost anything with Things Cloud, and that reliability is important, when it means the difference between getting someting done, and forgetting about it.</p> <h3>TuneIn Radio (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tunein-radio-pro-listen-to/id319295332?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3> <p>The BBC World Service News station is one that I have grown to love, many thanks to TuneIn Radio. It gives the user the opportunity to listen to radio stations being broadcast all around the world &mdash; even in different languages. I have learned a great deal of German, listening to Deutsche-Welle Nachrichten in this app. It works beautifully over 3G, too, which makes long car rides all the more pleasant.</p> <h3>Tweetbot for (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter-iphone/id428851691?mt=8">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter-ipad/id498801050?mt=8">iPad</a>, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter/id557168941?mt=12">Mac</a>)</h3> <p>Last, but certainly not least, I must acknowledge my addiction to Twitter. When I wake in the morning, I never fail to reach over, grab my iPhone, check my email, then check my Twitter feed. It usually takes a long breakfast to get through all of them, but I am able to change devices, due to syncing of my position via Tweet Marker. Before Tweetbot, I used Twitter for iPhone 3.5.1 (before that horrid redesign), but really wanted CloudApp support. Tweetbot was the natural alternative and everyone raved about it. After a couple weeks of using Tweetbot on a daily basis, I deleted Twitter for iPhone without hesitation. Tweetbot is the best way to interface with Twitter on any Apple device.</p> </div> </article> <div class="pagination"> <a class="prev" href="/page/3">&larr; Older</a> <a href="/archives/">Archives</a> <a class="next" href="/index.html">Newer &rarr;</a> </div> </div> <aside class="sidebar"> <section> <h1>Recent Posts</h1> <ul id="recent_posts"> <li class="post"> <a href="/2014/08/01/how-to-setup-your-own-github-pages/">A Hacker's Guide to Her Own GitHub Pages</a> </li> <li class="post"> <a href="/2014/07/16/dont-like-being-tracked/">Don’t Like Being Tracked?</a> </li> <li class="post"> <a href="/2014/04/27/clearing-up-confusion-around-baseurl/">Clearing Up Confusion Around baseurl</a> </li> <li class="post"> <a href="/2014/04/03/always-moving-forward/">Always Moving Forward</a> </li> <li class="post"> <a href="/2014/02/04/fixing-common-mistakes-when-working-with-ec2/">Fixing Common Mistakes when working with EC2</a> </li> </ul> </section> <section> <h1>GitHub Repos</h1> <ul id="gh_repos"> <li> <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a> <p>Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby.</p> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/parkr/centos-bootstrap">centos-bootstrap</a> <p>Hassle-free way to bootstrap CentOS 6.3 with development packages.</p> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/parkr/witness">witness</a> <p>Chat log server for humans</p> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress">Octopress</a> <p>Octopress is an obsessively designed framework for Jekyll blogging.</p> </li> </ul> <a href="https://github.com/parkr">@parkr</a> on GitHub </section> <section> <p>Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/parkr">@parkr</a></p> </section> </aside> </div> </div> <footer role="contentinfo"><p> Copyright &copy; 2014 - Parker Moore - <span class="credit">Powered by <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a></span> </p> </footer> </body> </html>
