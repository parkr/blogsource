  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I&#8217;ll admit it: I absolutely adore rbenv.</p>

<p>In light of this, I&#8217;ve been using it at my work at 6Wunderkinder the past couple weeks.
6W uses AWS like nobody&#8217;s business, and the Ubuntu EC2 instances I&#8217;ve been interacting
with are really bare-bones. So I wanted to write this script for you, the Ubuntu &amp; Ruby
user, in order for you to very quickly get up and running with rbenv &amp; the latest Ruby
MRI. Just copy it and run it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently signed up for simyo, a German cell provider. After installing the Nano SIM into my phone,
I noticed that the 3G connection to the mobile data network was failing. Got a weird error that said
I was not subscribed to a mobile data network. Which was obviously false.</p>

<p>So, I tweeted about it. Expecting a several-day delay in my support query from simyo, I totally resigned
to wait on mobile data until they got back to me. But luckily this new 6W family &amp; friends totally came
to my rescue. <a href="http://rafifyalda.id.au/">Rafif Yalda</a>, a former Wunderkind, totally came to my rescue in
<a href="https://twitter.com/rafifyalda/status/296664474885165056">a tweet</a>.</p>

<p>So if you ever run into a problem with your mobile network, ensure that your APN settings are correct.
In this case:</p>

<p>THANK YOU RAFIF. This surely saved me many hours of frustration.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Below is a list of the apps I wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to live without this year.
To be fair to everyone, I&#8217;ve listed them in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>I know some apps are missing links to various versions, but if I didn&#8217;t use it,
then I felt it was best not to include a link to it on this list.</p>

<h3>101 Airborne (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/101-airborne/id531317549?mt=8">iPhone</a>)</h3>

<p>At this moment, this is one of only two games which I have installed on my iPhone.
I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game, and it is incredibly well-done,
to boot.</p>

<h3>Diet Coda (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/diet-coda/id500906297?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>When I had to have the logic board in my MacBook Pro replaced, I had to hand in
my computer for a week. I am practically addicted to development, and this app
by Panic, Inc. of Portland, Oregon, served me well during those tough times.</p>

<h3>Dropbox (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/install">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Dropbox gives me the freedom to aimlessly roam between devices without losing
any progress. I can work on my mac for a bit, then pick up my iPad and resume
my work right then and there. Dropbox far surpasses the ease-of-use of competitors
such as Box.com, and its native Mac application is far less intrusive, as well.</p>

<h3>Google+ (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google+/id447119634?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m a social media weirdo. I have to try out every one that comes along. I even
tried out <a href="http://app.net">app.net</a> for a while (I still have an account there).
I started using this app far more after the amazing redesign which happened
right around Christmastime. It was indeed an enjoyable occasion. I use G+ to stay
in contact with friends who now work at Google and with friends of mine who insist
on Google-only living: an Android phone, Google+ to communicate (Messenger), and
Google Docs to collaborate.</p>

<h3>Google Chrome (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chrome/id535886823?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Chrome on Mac is absolutely awesome. I use it obsessively.</p>

<p>Chrome on the iPhone is something I had to warm up to a bit more. It behaves far
differently than Safari on iOS and the controls are in completely different places.
After some adjustment, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate its incredible flexibility and
strength in the mobile realm.</p>

<h3>Google Maps (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>Apple Maps has yet to lead me to a hospital that isn&#8217;t there, or on a road that has
been demolished, but I still missed the Google Maps speed and accuracy. I have also
found that Google Maps is far better for finding nearby amenities, such as coffee,
gas, and food.</p>

<h3>Google Translate (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-translate/id414706506?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>While I am relatively proficient in the language, learning German is a process.
I have found this app very helpful during my studies and even when having a
causal conversation over Skype in German.</p>

<h3>Gmail (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-from-google/id422689480?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>As with G+ above, the redesign really did it for me. It was, all of a sudden,
a reliable, beautiful, and agile experience, to use this app. It was incredibly
buggy before (it seemed to be a product from Google&#8217;s insistence that online
mobile apps will be dominant, over native apps), but it has come a long way.</p>

<h3>iA Writer (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id392502056?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id439623248?mt=12">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Whenever I have a thought that I want to remember and ponder later, I write it
down in a note. This usually happens while I am on-the-go. I will then come
back later and review my thoughts and ideas in iA Writer for Mac. I am so thankful
that iA Writer offers syncing through services like iCloud and Dropbox.</p>

<p>I have even been known to write essays on my iPhone of 1000+ words while I walk
between classes, to dinner in Collegetown, and to and from rehearsals. Two of the
three &#8220;A&#8221; papers I wrote last year (one writes few papers when studying engineering)
were written almost entirely in iA Writer for iOS.</p>

<h3>Instapaper (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>After much consideration, I decided to include this app on my list. I have used
Instapaper for many years now, and have truly enjoyed using it. It has,
unforunately, become a repository for articles I&#8217;d like to read, but probably
never will. I found Instapaper very useful, however, to pass the time during
long plane/car/bus rides, as well as long layovers between flights.</p>

<h3>iTerm2 (<a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Almost all of my development before May this year was done in Terminal.app.
While I have appreciated its service, I decided to move on to iTerm2 upon a
recommendation from a friend. iTerm2 is light and doesn&#8217;t have any weird &#8220;Mac
baggage&#8221; which Terminal.app does. It&#8217;s simple to configure (though there are
far too many configuration options, in my opinion), and easy to use.</p>

<h3>Lightroom 4 (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>When I first got my Mac, I bought Apple&#8217;s Aperture to handle photo editing and
management. When Lightroom 1 came out, I gave it a try and really enjoyed how
lightweight it felt. It&#8217;s incredibly easy to use, and its catalogs are quite
small, relative to Aperture&#8217;s. It is easily extendible, with custom plugins
for exporting photos and custom presets for one-click photo editing. I&#8217;ve since
stayed with Lightroom, and never looked back.</p>

<h3>Netflix (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>I have a slight obsession with Star Trek: The Next Generation, and, more
recently, with Star Trek: Voyager. Netflix has been a wonderful means of
distraction when I need to escape to the twenty-fourth century for some R &amp; R.</p>

<h3>Pages (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id361309726?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id409201541?mt=12">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Pages is similar to iA Writer, but built for presentation-geared reports and
papers. If the formatting matters, Pages is there to save the day. I wrote quite
a few lab reports on Pages for iOS.</p>

<h3>Paper (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id361309726?mt=8">iPad</a>)</h3>

<p>Paper by FiftyThree is pretty freakin&#8217; awesome. It&#8217;s incredibly agile, and very
robust. While I am no artist, it&#8217;s great for drawing up a quick website mock-up
and sending it off to colleagues. I am still in search of the right stylus, however
&mdash; I am using the Bamboo stylus from Wacom, but I need a tip which has more
precision for use with Paper. Let me know if you know of one I should pick up.</p>

<h3>Sparrow (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sparrow/id492573565?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sparrow/id417250177?mt=12">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>I have been using Sparrow since its private beta days, and I just love the thing.
Sparrow for Mac is a beaut&#8217; and Sparrow for iOS makes managing my Gmail accounts
so easy and painless, it&#8217;s almost too good to be true.</p>

<h3>Spotify (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotify/id324684580?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="http://www.spotify.com/us/download/mac/">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, I am not made of money, and my bank account resembles that which
one might expect of a poor college student. In my hopes to spend less on music,
I signed up for Spotify and have just loved it. I have discovered several new
artists that I have come to adore (can it get better than some Babyface or Marc
Broussard??), and for that, I am thankful. Spotify for iOS is a bit weird when
trying to initialize radio on a 3G connection, but it&#8217;s something I am willing
to live with for the time being.</p>

<h3>TextMate 2 Alpha (<a href="http://blog.macromates.com/2011/textmate-2-0-alpha/">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>As I mentioned above, I code endlessly. My trusty companion is TextMate 2. In 2006,
<a href="http://blog.dcxn.com">Nick Rowe</a> showed me what would become the text editor to
change my world. After learning all the key bindings, it was hard to switch when
I started learning more about vim. So I stuck with TextMate. When TextMate 2 Alpha
came out, I was never happier. Rebuilt from the ground up, it has all the memory
management I could have hoped for out of TextMate 1. I love this app with all of
my heart.</p>

<h3>Things 2 (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotify/id324684580?mt=8">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things/id407951449?mt=12">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Pretty much the only reason I&#8217;ve been productive this year is due to Things.
I was a beta tester for Things Cloud and Things 2 (both Mac and iOS) and was
delighted to find that this task-management application suite so quickly synced
all of my tasks, and <em>never</em> failed. I&#8217;ve never lost anything with Things Cloud,
and that reliability is important, when it means the difference between getting
someting done, and forgetting about it.</p>

<h3>TuneIn Radio (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tunein-radio-pro-listen-to/id319295332?mt=8">iOS</a>)</h3>

<p>The BBC World Service News station is one that I have grown to love, many thanks
to TuneIn Radio. It gives the user the opportunity to listen to radio stations
being broadcast all around the world &mdash; even in different languages. I have
learned a great deal of German, listening to Deutsche-Welle Nachrichten in this
app. It works beautifully over 3G, too, which makes long car rides all the more
pleasant.</p>

<h3>Tweetbot for (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter-iphone/id428851691?mt=8">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter-ipad/id498801050?mt=8">iPad</a>, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter/id557168941?mt=12">Mac</a>)</h3>

<p>Last, but certainly not least, I must acknowledge my addiction to Twitter. When
I wake in the morning, I never fail to reach over, grab my iPhone, check my email,
then check my Twitter feed. It usually takes a long breakfast to get through
all of them, but I am able to change devices, due to syncing of my position via
Tweet Marker. Before Tweetbot, I used Twitter for iPhone 3.5.1 (before that horrid
redesign), but really wanted CloudApp support. Tweetbot was the natural alternative
and everyone raved about it. After a couple weeks of using Tweetbot on a daily
basis, I deleted Twitter for iPhone without hesitation. Tweetbot is the best
way to interface with Twitter on any Apple device.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> is a static blog generator created by <a href="https://github.com/mojombo">Tom Preston-Werner</a>, the
current CEO of <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and one of GitHub&#8217;s co-founders, and by <a href="https://github.com/qrush">Nick Quaranto</a>,
who is now at 37signals. Jekyll is <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites">pretty freakin&#8217; popular</a> and it&#8217;s
also the engine that drives <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<p>After an hour-long chat with Tom, I&#8217;m optimistic about the future of Jekyll. He&#8217;s
really excited about where it&#8217;s headed and has a vision in mind about what he&#8217;d
like it to become.
Here&#8217;s what we ironed out during our conversation:</p>

<p>Led by Tom, a Jekyll development team, of which I&#8217;m the first recruit, will
be tackling the problems with Jekyll and continuously improving its functionality
and ease-of-use. The focus will remain on making a tool that allows one to easily
create and manage a static blog.</p>

<p>Suuuper basic (unofficial) design principles:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep it simple</li>
<li>Easy to extend</li>
<li>Solid safe mode (for GitHub Pages)</li>
</ol>


<p>What we need to tackle:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fix bugs (!!)</li>
<li>Decrease build time (!!)</li>
<li>Docs for site</li>
<li>TomDoc everything</li>
<li>Release new site</li>
<li>Finish same site generator</li>
<li>Include some faster LSI</li>
</ol>

Want to contribute code? Check out the <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues">issues</a> and submit a pull request with
a fix.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really excited about the immediate future of Jekyll and what it will become
in the next 6 months or so and the dev team takes on the issues outlined above.
I hope you&#8217;re as excited as we are to get this project back on its feet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Email notifications from web apps have been annoying us for months now. Ever since Twitter, Facebook and other notification-heavy apps began automatically sending notifications to us (alas, without our consent), public opinion seems to have developed a hatred for email notifications. But, I implore you, understand the flipside:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I really don’t need your web service to keep another inbox of messages and notifications for me.</p>&mdash; Marco Arment (@marcoarment) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/statuses/278705209507721217">December 12, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Email notifications in web apps is a way of unifying one&#8217;s virtual &#8220;inbox&#8221;. Dealing with too many is overwhelming.</p>

<p>Keep email notifications around.</p>

<p>(But, for pete&#8217;s sake, <em>ask</em> your users whether they want email notifications before you activate them for their accounts.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a huge advocate of static site generators and have always favoured <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> as my go-to static site generator.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s fallen out of active development. I&#8217;ve been trying to contact Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo">@mojombo</a>) about it, but so far: nothing. (To be fair, I have gotten two replies, but they were not productive other than saying that he was looking for new maintainers. That was May 2012.)</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s my open letter to you, Tom, about saving   Jekyll from open-source oblivion.</p>

<blockquote><p>Tom,</p>

<p>Hope you had a pleasant weekend.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I wish to see happen with Jekyll:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start an Org on Github and move the Jekyll repo to that org</li>
<li>Add several maintainers to that org (I&#8217;d be happy to help out as a maintainer!)</li>
<li>Add another author or two to the Jekyll gem so that we can gem push and release new versions.</li>
<li>Give at least one other person access to push to the source of jekyllrb.com so that the docs can be updated</li>
</ol>


<p>Problem I&#8217;m trying to solve:</p>

<blockquote><p>Jekyll is incredibly popular and is an incredibly powerful tool, but is not being actively maintained centrally, so though the world around it is evolving, it is staying stagnant and plagued by the same issues it has been for the last four years.</p></blockquote>

<p>Solution:</p>

<blockquote><p>Add maintainers to Jekyll to help deal with issues, push new versions, and update the documentation when you don&#8217;t have the time.</p></blockquote>

<p>The great thing about version control systems is that changes can always be reverted.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your attention to this problem and willingness to help it continue growing.</p>

<p>Warm Regards,<br>
Parker Moore</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have really adored iA Writer and use the app obsessively on my iPhone, iPad and Mac. It&#8217;s arguably one of my most oft-used apps. I write all sorts of things with the app: blog posts/ideas (like this one), essays, lab reports &#8211; even the occasional code snippet. It&#8217;s my writing tool of choice, and I thank Information Architects for writing such an awesome app.</p>

<p>I also print out a lot of my writing. I like to edit by hand with a pen and paper. I like the beautiful typeface that iA Writer provides and the margins on 8.5&#8221; x 11&#8221; paper (US) are amazing. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed the almost typewriter-like essence of the print-outs which iA Writer provides.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d really love some more configuration options for printing, however. While I will undoubtedly hear the argument that iA Writer offers no configuration <em>on purpose</em>, I will argue that the &#8220;No Configuration Rule&#8221; must only apply to in-app writing, not to the manifestation of this writing in paper form.</p>

<p>The No Configuration Rule is supported by the fact that configuration and modification of the working environment is often a hindrance to one&#8217;s ability to write awesome content. It&#8217;s a distraction. But it&#8217;s a distraction only when <em>writing</em>, not when printing. I&#8217;d say this No Configuration Rule thus can only be justified for writing, i.e. on;y be justified for the look and feel of the writing experience in the app.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s an argument with too many implications. Let&#8217;s make it a bit smaller, to the size of a wish:</p>

<p>My only real wish for this app is to allow double-spaced print-outs. That&#8217;s it. I want to be able to edit my papers double-spaced.</p>

<p>So what say you, Information Architects? Think it&#8217;s possible? I&#8217;d really appreciate it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve decided to take next semester off (Spring 2013) to pursue an internship at <a href="http://6wunderkinder.com">6Wunderkinder</a> in Berlin, Germany. I&#8217;ll be starting work at the end of January and returning to the U.S. around the middle of August. I&#8217;m very excited that 6Wunderkinder extended their offer for an internship to me and were down with a 6-7 month internship. I&#8217;m pumped to be working with such awesome web and app devs.</p>

<p>So how did this happen? It&#8217;s a long story that I&#8217;ll talk about later, but for now I&#8217;ll give you the abridged version.</p>

<p>In the bleak winter of 2011, I emailed 6W about the possibility of a 3-month summer internship (May, June, July) in 2013. They replied very kindly, basically saying that it was way too early to say whether that was a possibility.</p>

<p>This Fall, I sent them a follow-up email asking if they were still interested. They replied saying that it was a definite possibility and asked that I send along some projects I had worked on. After reviewing my email &#8220;project resume&#8221;, they offered me an interview. Thanksgiving morning, I woke up bright and early to meet Ben on Skype. Great fun, and got to meet Isaac and Alex of the 6W API team, too. Ben followed up with an email offering a second interview.</p>

<p>During the time between the first and second interviews, I decided that I needed a break from my studies - Cornell is a particularly rigorous place and has a tendency to be demoralizing. So it was time for a break so that I could return in the Fall with new energy and vigor. I shot Ben an email indicating my interest in starting to work for them as early as the end of January, and to my surprise, were very interested in having me earlier.</p>

<p>During the second interview, I talked with Isaac and Ben more about what my role at 6Wunderkinder would be and how life in Berlin would look for me. All seemed really cool. When Ben officially made the offer to have me as an intern, I gladly accepted and we discussed logistics.</p>

<p>So there it is! It&#8217;s amazing what an email can do nowadays when you have congruent interests and a cool, responsive company like 6W.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to really miss <a href="http://theclassnotes.com">The Class Notes</a>, the <a href="http://gleeclub.com">Glee Club</a> (no, not like the show &#8220;Glee&#8221;), and my other friends here, and the ease of college life. That being said, I&#8217;m really grateful for this amazing opportunity abroad with a one-of-a-kind start-up like 6W.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Ben Braun, Isaac Wolkerstorfer, Alex Koppel, and the whole 6Wunderkinder team for giving me the opportunity. Thanks, guys!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may have heard about the recent eruption of violence in Israel and the
Gaza Strip. You may have your opinions set, but just hear me out.</p>

<p>So the way the story goes is that Gaza has been firing lots of rockets
into Israel and Israel has decided to retaliate by firing its own rockets
and otherwise bombarding the Gaza Strip with explosives. So, fire and fire
are at work here.</p>

<p>This is wrong. Hamas (the current leaders of Gaza) is wrong and Israel is
wrong. There is nothing morally justifiable about what either party is doing.</p>

<p>Many have expressed sympathy with Israel and an acquaintance of mine even
posted <a href="">a video produced by the Israel Defense Forces about why it has the
right to retaliate</a> on Facebook. There is absolutely no &#8220;right&#8221; to kill
anyone. No one can justifiably kill anyone else.</p>

<p>Enter: moral excusability. While killing another human being is <em>never</em> morally
justifiable, it is often viewed as morally excusable. That is, it is not
<em>right</em> to kill another human being, but it isn&#8217;t wrong (given the circumstances)
either. Well, that&#8217;s bullshit. If something isn&#8217;t morally justifiable, don&#8217;t do
it.</p>

<p>This eye-for-an-eye thing is getting out of hand. Both parties need to stop
hurting each other and begin discussing what can be done to peacefull coexist.
Unless Israel kills all the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, there will never
be peace. Unfortunately, it seems like their hawkish Prime Minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, is just about ready to kill off every non-Israeli in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>This whole situation is just despicable.</p>

      <p class="meta">

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Higher education is messed up. The incentives for learning as well as the structure of that learning is all wrong.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s this perspective? Well, let&#8217;s define elements of this proposition. By &#8220;wrong&#8221;, i mean &#8220;not conducive to the best mastery of the material&#8221; and by &#8220;structure of that learning&#8221;, I&#8217;m talking about the overlap of classes &mdash; the simultaneous learning associated with taking more than one class during any one period of time. By &#8220;incentives&#8221;, I mean &#8220;grades&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Grades</h3>

<p>Grades suck. Just about every student who&#8217;s been evaluated and given a letter to indicate achievement will agree: tears have been shed and jobs have been lost &mdash; careers ruined &mdash; because of a letter.</p>

<p>At grade-obsessed Cornell University, the grade is the entire reason anyone seems to do anything. High grades are rewarded and low grades are punished. But how much do grades mean? Do they <em>actually</em> measure the success and mastery of the material, or do they just exist to weed out &#8220;smart&#8221; from &#8220;stupid&#8221;? I&#8217;d argue that grades say nothing about <em>true</em> mastery. Rather, they say &#8220;I can take a test well,&#8221; and &#8220;I can write you an essay you think is good.&#8221; But they don&#8217;t necessarily say, &#8220;I know this and understand every bit of it.&#8221; Too often, students memorize but don&#8217;t truly understand.</p>

<p>Teachers &mdash; at any level &mdash; should ask more questions which force students to synthesize their knowledge and undersanding and not bother trying to label the &#8220;success&#8221; with a letter. These letters try to boil a student&#8217;s worth down to an arbitrary orthographic symbol. We, the students, should learn by reading and asking questions. The more time we have alone with the material &mdash; for intraspection to develop true understanding &mdash; the more certain it is that it is true mastery we are achieving. Until the master thinks we have mastered the material, we need to continue learning and trying to understand the material.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>Structure is also a problem. We really ought to focus on <em>one</em> topic and worth with it until we have truly mastered the material. Before mastery, we must not be distracted by other things. We must imerse ourselves in the topic entirelty and not let anything get in the way of our mastery.</p>

<p>The simultaneous class system must go. Take a class, perhaps one every three or four weeks, and do not move on until it is finished and mastery has been achieved. Once one has reached the mastery equivalent to that which the professor believes is true and perfect, then a new topic can be studied. Until then, we mustn&#8217;t move on &mdash; mastery is the highest value of education.</p>

<h3>A New System</h3>

<p>This new system will guarantee that every student has the same level of mastery and develops a personal connection with the masters and the material. One topic at a time and commitment to mastery rather than arbitrary grades and skewed test results, this new system uses the intuition of the master in knowing when the student has achieved his or her potential.</p>

<p>Incentives are misaligned. It&#8217;s no longer about learning &mdash; it&#8217;s about being told you&#8217;re learning, even if you&#8217;re not. It&#8217;s time we realign incentives and learn to learn and master the material.</p>
