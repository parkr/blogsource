  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been at <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell</a> for a little over a week and I can honestly admit I&#8217;ve never been this busy. Thanks to my time at McGill, I have been able to manage my time well, but this is a new level of busy for me!</p>

<p>Coursework has been relatively do-able; I&#8217;ve had 3 assignments and 7 readings to do. All in all, not too bad for 3 days of classes. Judging from what I know at this moment, <a href="http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=12&amp;coid=90911"><strong>CS2110</strong></a> is probably going to be the most work. Much of the theory behind the algorithms and mathematical problems is new to me and I suspect that will be the most difficult aspect of this class. <a href="http://www.infosci.cornell.edu/ugrad/CalsMajor.htm"><strong>INFO1300</strong></a> (Intro to Web Design), if I can&#8217;t obtain an exemption from the course, will be a cinch. I really don&#8217;t expect any issues with that class at all. <a href="http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=12&amp;coid=93470"><strong>INFO 2040</strong></a> will be lots of work, but the concepts we&#8217;re learning don&#8217;t seem too difficult to grasp. It&#8217;s also a huge class, so there&#8217;s plenty of opportunity to ask questions to others. It has a good reputation, too. <a href="http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=12&amp;coid=91639"><strong>EDUC2710</strong></a> is already turning out to be one of my favourite classes. Going to be a <em>lot</em> of work, but it&#8217;ll be worth it. I was recently given permission to enroll in <a href="http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=12&amp;coid=90949&amp;print"><strong>CS4999</strong></a>, a class where I conduct research and write web apps for college credit. All in all, a good deal.</p>

<p>Cornell offers wonderful academics, but I would argue that the extracurricular opportunities rival those in the academic world. I have chosen to get involved in the music scene here, having been accepted into the <a href="http://www.gleeclub.com/">Cornell Glee Club</a> just last night! A Cappella auditions are this week, and I&#8217;m still working on those. I&#8217;m also hoping to get involved with the <a href="http://www.cornellsun.com/">Cornell Daily Sun</a> as a web developer. There are a couple other clubs I&#8217;m looking into, but those are sort of on hold while auditions ensue.</p>

<p>In addition to all of this, I am a free-lance web developer/designer. I&#8217;m really excited to continue my Cornell experience. It&#8217;s amazing here and I don&#8217;t want to waste even one minute. Let&#8217;s end in song:</p>

<blockquote><p>  Far above Cayuga&#8217;s waters,<br />
  With its waves of blue,<br />
  Stands our noble Alma Mater,<br />
  Glorious to view.<br />
  <br />
  Lift the chorus, speed it onward,<br />
  Loud her praises tell;<br />
  Hail to thee, our Alma Mater!<br />
  Hail, all hail, Cornell!<br />
  <br />
  Far above the busy humming<br />
  Of the bustling town,<br />
  Reared against the arch of heaven,<br />
  Looks she proudly down.<br />
  <br />
  Lift the chorus, speed it onward,<br />
  Loud her praises tell;<br />
  Hail to thee, our Alma Mater!<br />
  Hail, all hail, Cornell!</p></blockquote>

<p>I look forward to sharing more with you about Cornell and my experiences here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep, I code in <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a>. Before you start knocking the language around for its antiquated syntax or what have you, I would like to explain.</p>

<p>(This post was inspired by <a href="http://beust.com/weblog/2011/08/09/i-like-php/">Cedric&#8217;s post about PHP</a>. I agree, but wanted to elaborate a little more.)</p>

<h3>The Sites I Work On Are Written in PHP</h3>

<p>Pretty simple. I have done a lot of work with WordPress, CodeIgniter and CakePHP. Their seamless integration with the MySQL backend makes them prime content management systems for clients. Every server I&#8217;ve ever worked with has had PHP 5 installed on it with a MySQL database. Deploying to these systems requires only the most basic tools (I could theoretically use <code>scp</code> to move all my files to the server).</p>

<h3>PHP is Popular</h3>

<p>More websites are written with a PHP backend than any other language. Ruby is on the rise with <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>&#8217;s easy deployment structure for Rails applications, but it&#8217;s still an underdog at this point. Another benefit of being popular is that PHP is well-documented and therefore the learning curve is less steep than with Ruby.</p>

<h3>PHP is Awesome</h3>

<p>That&#8217;s right: PHP is awesome. I have used PHP for server scripting since I began more advanced coding in 8th grade. It&#8217;s been 6 years and I have written more in PHP than in any other language, despite having written 2 decently sized web apps with ROR. I love PHP and you should too. At least don&#8217;t discount its abilities.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was just reading through <a href="http://www.google.com/accounts/TOS?hl=en&amp;loc=US">Google+&#8217;s Terms of Service</a> because I was interested to see what was to happen to my images, should I upload them to Google+. I am weary to upload photos to <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, because Facebook claims rights to my images and may do with them whatever it pleases. This bothers me, and I wanted to see if Google+ was going to be the same.</p>

<p>If you read Section 9, it states:</p>

<blockquote><p>9.4   Other than the limited license set forth in Section 11, Google acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content that you submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds peachy, doesn&#8217;t it? I would propose that Google&#8217;s betting you&#8217;re lazy and, if you read the TOS at <em>all</em>, you sure as hell won&#8217;t follow the references. Well, I did. Here&#8217;s Section 11:</p>

<blockquote><p>11.2   You agree that this license includes a right for Google to make such Content available to other companies, organizations or individuals with whom Google has relationships for the provision of syndicated services, and to use such Content in connection with the provision of those services.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hm. Not so good. I would really prefer that the stated &#8220;other companies, organizations or individuals&#8221; <strong>not</strong> have access to my content. But there&#8217;s that phrase where, if you&#8217;re not in the business, you wouldn&#8217;t understand: <em>syndicated services</em>. Hm. What <em>is</em> that?</p>

<p>Well, I have an answer for you. From <a href="http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/definition/syndication">TechTarget&#8217;s definition</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>For many years mainly a feature of print media, today content syndication is the way a great deal of information is disseminated across the Web. Reuters, for example, provides online news content to over 900 Web sites and portals, such as Yahoo and America Online.</p></blockquote>

<p>So Google or any of its affiliates who fall into the above category are allowed to disseminate my information across the Web.</p>

<p>No thank you. I think I&#8217;ll post them somewhere else, thanks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was recently cleaning out my room at home (I&#8217;m back from college for the summer) and found an old <code>git</code> cheat-sheet. I thought I would electronically log it for future reference (as though I don&#8217;t use git every day or something&#8230;).</p>

<pre><code>git init
git clone git://github.com/username/repo.git
git add filename
git status [-s]
git diff [--cached] [HEAD] [--stat]
git commit [-a] [-m "commit message"]
git reset [HEAD]
git rm [--cached] filename 
    # (by adding --cached, the file that's deleted 
    # will be left in your local directory)

git branch branchname
git checkout branchname
git checkout -b branchname
git branch -d branchname # (delete)

git merge branchname # (merges 'branchname' to current branch)
git mv file newfile
git log [--oneline] [--graph] [branchname] [^compared_branch_name]

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I picked up some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman">Walt Whitman</a> poems yesterday at the library at the recommendation of a friend. I expected to enjoy <a href="#walt-whitman-source-1" title="Source: Walt Whitman: Selected Poems - edited by Harold Bloom">what I read</a>, but ne&#8217;er thought I would absolutely <em>crave</em> it. Lo and behold, that is what it has turned out to be: a true love story between a man and another man&#8217;s poetry.</p>

<p>I will use tonight&#8217;s post to archive some excerpts I particularly enjoy. I will not attempt to explain or analyze them; that&#8217;s for you to do.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am satisfied&mdash;I see, dance, laugh, sing;<br>
As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side<br></p>

<blockquote><p>through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the<br>
day with stealthy tread,<br>
Leaving me baskets cover&#8217;d with white towels swelling<br>
the house with their plenty,<br>
Shall I postpone my acception and realization and<br>
scream at my eyes,<br>
That they turn from gazing after and down the road,<br>
And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,<br>
Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two,<br>
and which is ahead?<br>
<span class="source-page">(p. 14)</span></p></blockquote>

<p>I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;itself to you,<br>
And you must not be abased to the other.<br>
<span class="source-page">(p. 16)</span></p></blockquote>

<p>I expect to post more excerpts as I continue through the book. For now, good night.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Oh, what joy! What rapture! We are young and unafraid; let all of christendom rejoice with us, for we are young!</em></p>

<p>Sometimes I think that being young is wonderful and sometimes I wish I could fast-forward time for 3 years, at which time I will have graduated from college and hopefully have a job. I was just dreaming about interning with <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> next summer if the DIA internships don&#8217;t come through. I&#8217;m young - I can ask for a student discount and feel more than entitled. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I enjoy this, but I wish to have more responsibility. I am working on 3 websites this summer for various organizations, but find myself wanting more. I have a job at the local supermarket, but it&#8217;s menial and I feel as though the skills I have accrued are going unused. I want to use my skills - and get paid doing so.</p>

<p>I wonder if there is something I can do this summer - another organization I can work for - that would pay me for developing a website or a piece of software. Well, I have time. I may as well enjoy these summers I have before trying to give them away for money.</p>

<p>As an aside, I may continue with these late-night writings. I rather like them.</p>

<time datetime="2011-05-24T03:16:42+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 24<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently began listening to rather disturbing amounts of classical music. A friend of mine attends a music conservatory where he studies vocal performance, and my visit there really solidified a love that I have for classical music. I find myself mostly looking into choral pieces by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_music">Romantic-era</a> composers.</p>

<p>My favourite as of late has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Faur%C3%A9">Gabriel Fauré</a>. His <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Requiem</a> is just too good. Of all the music I&#8217;ve downloaded thus far (that&#8217;s 142 songs), his Requiem (7 tracks) is by far the most-played. The intensity that Fauré displays in his compositions shines through in this particular work. Listening to &#8220;Libera Me&#8221; is almost overwhelming; I am filled with every emotion imaginable.</p>

<p>Ok, it&#8217;s time for a digression. I have been asked by many why I enjoy classical music. &#8220;I just find it boring,&#8221; the inquirer may say. To that, I say &#8220;fooey!&#8221; The emotion provoked by classical music (much of it, anyhow) is most certainly a strength that is not found in today&#8217;s music; the myriad emotions felt by the listener is tremendously important to the enjoyment of the music. Of the friends I have asked, many report feeling &#8220;young&#8221; when listening to artists such as Lady Gaga, Kanye West and other notable artists of the here-and-now. But these artists will most likely never experience the sheer fusion that our society currently experiences with classical music. This longevity of appreciation that classical music enjoys is unquestionably magnificent. It is perhaps not a surprise that the &#8220;trendy&#8221; music never takes hold: we don&#8217;t find very many fans of 80&#8217;s music as it compares to 21st-century music for the very reason that it&#8217;s no longer &#8220;trendy&#8221;&#8230; it&#8217;s been 30 years.</p>

<p>I believe all people should cultivate some regard for classical music. If we incorporated emotion into the enjoyment of music again (other than the feeling of &#8220;being young&#8221; which we get from much of today&#8217;s popular music), we would probablt be a much happier society. &#8220;Parker, that&#8217;s a rather ridiculous claim,&#8221; you might say. Well, let me mention one more thing before you give up on me. Society would be happier (better) if we incorporatied an understanding and appreciation for classical music becayse we would learn how to truly appreciate other joys of life; one might begin to appreciate the cellphone in his pocket rather than throwing it to the ground so that he can receive the newest model or something like that. Oughtn&#8217;t we be just glad that we have something such as that without wanting <em>more</em>? It seems excessive to me to ask for that which you already have.</p>

<p>I appreciate classical music for all of its quirks and not all composers hae written music which I like. But that is beside the point; we must first cultivate an understanding and appreciation for what we have (in my case, these tracks of music) and extend that same appreciation on to other things, such as the food we eat and the clothes we wear. And no, admiration for what we do have has <em>nothing</em> to do with wanting something new; in fact, it is quite the opposite. Take that into consideration next time you are looking to trash something that is perfectly good and from which you gain a lot of utility.</p>

<p>This completes an installment of &#8220;Late-night Musings&#8221; with Parker. I hope you enjoyed my somewhat jumbled and redundant thoughts. It&#8217;s been a pleasure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote a nice post about sleep, and lost it all because &#8220;Kod&#8221; unexpectedly quit and I didn&#8217;t save it.
Darn it.</p>

<h3>Second try.</h3>

<p>Sleep is a basic human need. All people understand that. In fact, some organizations exploit this need. For example, a torture - sorry, &#8220;enhanced interrrogation&#8221; - techinque is sleep-deprivation. This technique inflicts great pain on the subject, as well as insanity and possibly death if the subject endures the deprivation for long enough. Most people see this deprivation as a terrible thing; a thing to be called a violation of human rights. Why, then, do we willingly inflict this pain on ourselves?</p>

<p>Western society teaches sleep-deprivation from an early age. In high school, a kid receives bragging rights after pulling an all-nighter. He or she is seen as really cool to all of his or her friends for doing something &#8220;bad&#8221; (probably just staying up past his or her bedtime&#8230;). The problem only exacerbates, however, in college, due to the immense workload that many (most) students take on. As the years progress and the work becomes more difficult, the students lose more and more sleep. They may sleep the proper number of hours over the weekend, but only if no work is to be done until the (late) afternoon and the party wasn&#8217;t too rough the night before (alcohol deteriorates sleep quality).</p>

<p>The problem doesn&#8217;t end there! The business world also robs its community members of sleep: an 8 am deal after a 1 am dinner party (they party hard). Bosses load on the work to their employees, many of whom are also busy with new children or the remains of a social life post-college. 5 hours of sleep is not enough - we know that, right?</p>

<p>So why do we insist on limiting the amount of sleep that we do get? The question is this: how do we mold society to allow the proper amount of sleep while still delivering all of the goodies we get today? Can we stagger work to the appropriate time, so that if work starts early, so does sleep? Would it be possible just to shut down the community for 8 hours a day (preferably when it&#8217;s dark)?</p>

<p>This post is not meant as a solution. Just a 5-in-the-morning rambling. Cheers.</p>
