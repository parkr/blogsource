    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was fortunate enough to, just today, pick up a new computer. My first hardware
in over 4 years, I had been holding off. Once my trusty MacBook Pro bit the dust
last night and I found out the repair cost was extraordinary, I bit the bullet.</p>

<p>So, you're probably in a similar place. You relatively recently got a shiny new
Macintosh and you're so excited to start writing code and making a difference
with those skillz of yours. Except one this is missing: <a href="https://github.com/wincent/Command-T">Command-T</a>.</p>

<p>Lucky for you, sir, I am here to help. OS X Maverick's built-in vim distribution
comes with Ruby support already (which it needs for Command-T) so you're good
there. Now you need to download and compile Command-T. Should be easy, right?
Well, not quite.</p>

<p>Mavericks was notable for Ruby users because it ships with Ruby 2.0. All
previous versions that I had ever used shipped with 1.8.7 so this was a huge
bonus. Problem is, your pre-installed vim wasn't compiled with 2.0.0, it was
compiled with 1.8.7.</p>

<p>To check this, run the following in vim in NORMAL mode:</p>

<pre><code class="text">:ruby puts "#{RUBY_VERSION}-p#{RUBY_PATCHLEVEL}"
</code></pre>

<p>For me, that output <code>1.8.7-p358</code>. So that means the Ruby verison that vim is
using is <code>1.8.7-p358</code>, and we need to compile Command-T with that version. To do
so, install it:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ rbenv install 1.8.7-p358
</code></pre>

<p>Boom! Now download and install Command-T:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/wincent/Command-T.git ~/.vim/bundle/Command-T
$ cd ~/.vim/bundle/Command-T # for tpope's Pathogen
$ rbenv local 1.8.7-p358
$ rbenv rehash
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake make
</code></pre>

<p>Aaaaand boom, you're done. Open up <code>vim</code> and type your leaderkey then <code>t</code> (for
me, that's <code>,t</code>) to launch the prompt.</p>

<p>If you get a weird SIGTERM error when you launch <code>vim</code>, then you installed
Command-T with the wrong Ruby version. Remove <code>ruby/command-t/ext.bundle</code> and
try again.</p>
