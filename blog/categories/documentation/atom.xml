    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently signed up for simyo, a German cell provider. After installing the Nano SIM into my phone,
I noticed that the 3G connection to the mobile data network was failing. Got a weird error that said
I was not subscribed to a mobile data network. Which was obviously false.</p>

<p>So, I tweeted about it. Expecting a several-day delay in my support query from simyo, I totally resigned
to wait on mobile data until they got back to me. But luckily this new 6W family &amp; friends totally came
to my rescue. <a href="http://rafifyalda.id.au/">Rafif Yalda</a>, a former Wunderkind, totally came to my rescue in
<a href="https://twitter.com/rafifyalda/status/296664474885165056">a tweet</a>.</p>

<p>So if you ever run into a problem with your mobile network, ensure that your APN settings are correct.
In this case:</p>

<p><code>
APN: internet.eplus.de
username: simyo
password: simyo
</code></p>

<p>THANK YOU RAFIF. This surely saved me many hours of frustration.</p>
