    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The late comedian George Carlin was never skiddish about sharing his opinion of the
country and of the human race. "It's all going downhill," he would say. The decline of
objective rationality sewed our fate: we're fucked.</p>

<p>We're fucked on foreign relations.<br />
We're fucked on domestic freedoms.<br />
We're fucked on freedom from discrimination.<br />
We're fucked on climate change.<br />
We're fucked on economic prosperity.<br />
We're fucked on everything, because objective rationality is dead.<br /></p>

<p>We haven't done right by each other and we haven't done right by our planet.
We're the scourge of the Earth and it's weeks like this one that make me wish we had blown
ourselves to oblivion during the Cold War. The cockroaches would at least be better
caretakers of this world than we are.</p>
